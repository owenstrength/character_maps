       <said>This figure hath high price: 't was wrought with love
        Ages ago in finest ivory;
        Nought modish in it, pure and noble lines
        Of generous womanhood that fits all time
        That too is costly ware; majolica
        Of deft design, to please a lordly eye:
        The smile, you see, is perfect—wonderful
        As mere Faience! a table ornament
        To suit the richest mounting.</said>

Dorothea seldom left home without her husband, but she did occasionally
drive into Middlemarch alone, on little errands of shopping or charity
such as occur to every lady of any wealth when she lives within three
miles of a town. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> Two days after that scene in the Yew-tree Walk, she
determined to use such an opportunity in order if possible to see
Lydgate, and learn from him whether her husband had really felt any
depressing change of symptoms which he was concealing from her, and
whether he had insisted on knowing the utmost about himself.  She felt
almost guilty in asking for knowledge about him from another, but the
dread of being without it—the dread of that ignorance which would make
her unjust or hard—overcame every scruple.  That there had been some
crisis in her husband's mind she was certain:</said> he had the very next day
begun a new method of arranging his notes, and had associated her quite
newly in carrying out his plan.  Poor Dorothea needed to lay up stores
of patience.
</P>

<P>
It was about four o'clock when she drove to Lydgate's house in Lowick
Gate, <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> wishing, in her immediate doubt of finding him at home, that she
had written beforehand.  And he was not at home. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?</said> said Dorothea, <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> who had never, that she knew
of, seen Rosamond, but now remembered the fact of the marriage.  Yes,
Mrs. Lydgate was at home. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#unnamed">I will go in and speak to her, if she will allow me.  Will you ask her
if she can see me—see Mrs. Casaubon, for a few minutes?</said>
</P>

<P>
When the servant had gone to deliver that message, Dorothea could hear
sounds of music through an open window—a few notes from a man's voice
and then a piano bursting into roulades.  But the roulades broke off
suddenly, and then the servant came back saying that Mrs. Lydgate would
be happy to see Mrs. Casaubon.
</P>

<P>
When the drawing-room door opened and Dorothea entered, there was a
sort of contrast not infrequent in country life when the habits of the
different ranks were less blent than now. <first> Let those who know, tell us
exactly what stuff it was that Dorothea wore in those days of mild
autumn—that thin white woollen stuff soft to the touch and soft to the
eye. </first> It always seemed to have been lately washed, and to smell of the
sweet hedges—was always in the shape of a pelisse with sleeves hanging
all out of the fashion. <first> Yet if she had entered before a still audience
as Imogene or Cato's daughter, the dress might have seemed right
enough: the grace and dignity were in her limbs and neck; and about her
simply parted hair and candid eyes the large round poke which was then
in the fate of women, seemed no more odd as a head-dress than the gold
trencher we call a halo. </first> By the present audience of two persons, no
dramatic heroine could have been expected with more interest than Mrs.
Casaubon.  <said who="#R" direct="false" aloud="false"> To Rosamond she was one of those county divinities not
mixing with Middlemarch mortality, whose slightest marks of manner or
appearance were worthy of her study; moreover, Rosamond was not without
satisfaction that Mrs. Casaubon should have an opportunity of studying
<emph rend="italics">her</emph>. <second>What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the
best judges? and since Rosamond had received the highest compliments at
Sir Godwin Lydgate's, she felt quite confident of the impression she
must make on people of good birth.</second> </said> Dorothea put out her hand with her
usual simple kindness, and looked admiringly at Lydgate's lovely
bride—aware that there was a gentleman standing at a distance, but
seeing him merely as a coated figure at a wide angle.  The gentleman
was too much occupied with the presence of the one woman to reflect on
the contrast between the two—a contrast that would certainly have been
striking to a calm observer.  They were both tall, and their eyes were
on a level; but imagine Rosamond's infantine blondness and wondrous
crown of hair-plaits, with her pale-blue dress of a fit and fashion so
perfect that no dressmaker could look at it without emotion, a large
embroidered collar which it was to be hoped all beholders would know
the price of, her small hands duly set off with rings, and that
controlled self-consciousness of manner which is the expensive
substitute for simplicity.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Thank you very much for allowing me to interrupt you,</said> said Dorothea,
immediately.  <said who="#D">I am anxious to see Mr. Lydgate, if possible, before I
go home, and I hoped that you might possibly tell me where I could find
him, or even allow me to wait for him, if you expect him soon.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">He is at the New Hospital,</said> said Rosamond; <said who="#R">I am not sure how soon he
will come home.  But I can send for him.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad"Will you let me go and fetch him?</said> said Will Ladislaw, coming forward.
He had already taken up his hat before Dorothea entered.  She colored
with surprise, but put out her hand with a smile of unmistakable
pleasure, saying—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I did not know it was you: I had no thought of seeing you here.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">May I go to the Hospital and tell Mr. Lydgate that you wish to see
him?</said> said Will.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">It would be quicker to send the carriage for him,</said> said Dorothea, <said who="#D">if
you will be kind enough to give the message to the coachman.</said>
</P>

<P>
Will was moving to the door when Dorothea, whose mind had flashed in an
instant over many connected memories, turned quickly and said, <said who="#D">I will
go myself, thank you.  I wish to lose no time before getting home
again.  I will drive to the Hospital and see Mr. Lydgate there.  Pray
excuse me, Mrs. Lydgate.  I am very much obliged to you.</said>
</P>

<P>
Her mind was evidently arrested by some sudden thought, and she left
the room hardly conscious of what was immediately around her—hardly
conscious that Will opened the door for her and offered her his arm to
lead her to the carriage.  She took the arm but said nothing.  Will was
feeling rather vexed and miserable, and found nothing to say on his
side.  He handed her into the carriage in silence, they said good-by,
and Dorothea drove away.
</P>

<P>
In the five minutes' drive to the Hospital she had time for some
reflections that were quite new to her. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> Her decision to go, and her
preoccupation in leaving the room, had come from the sudden sense that
there would be a sort of deception in her voluntarily allowing any
further intercourse between herself and Will which she was unable to
mention to her husband, and already her errand in seeking Lydgate was a
matter of concealment.  That was all that had been explicitly in her
mind; but she had been urged also by a vague discomfort.  Now that she
was alone in her drive, she heard the notes of the man's voice and the
accompanying piano, which she had not noted much at the time, returning
on her inward sense; and she found herself thinking with some wonder
that Will Ladislaw was passing his time with Mrs. Lydgate in her
husband's absence.  And then she could not help remembering that he had
passed some time with her under like circumstances, so why should there
be any unfitness in the fact?  But Will was Mr. Casaubon's relative,
and one towards whom she was bound to show kindness.  Still there had
been signs which perhaps she ought to have understood as implying that
Mr. Casaubon did not like his cousin's visits during his own absence. </said>
<said who="#D">Perhaps I have been mistaken in many things,</said> said poor Dorothea to
herself, while the tears came rolling and she had to dry them quickly.
She felt confusedly unhappy, and the image of Will which had been so
clear to her before was mysteriously spoiled.  But the carriage stopped
at the gate of the Hospital.  She was soon walking round the grass
plots with Lydgate, and her feelings recovered the strong bent which
had made her seek for this interview.
</P>

<P>
Will Ladislaw, meanwhile, was mortified, and knew the reason of it
clearly enough. <said who="#LAD" direct="false" aloud="false"> His chances of meeting Dorothea were rare; and here
for the first time there had come a chance which had set him at a
disadvantage.  It was not only, as it had been hitherto, that she was
not supremely occupied with him, but that she had seen him under
circumstances in which he might appear not to be supremely occupied
with her.  He felt thrust to a new distance from her, amongst the
circles of Middlemarchers who made no part of her life.  But that was
not his fault: of course, since he had taken his lodgings in the town,
he had been making as many acquaintances as he could, his position
requiring that he should know everybody and everything.  Lydgate was
really better worth knowing than any one else in the neighborhood, and
he happened to have a wife who was musical and altogether worth calling
upon.  Here was the whole history of the situation in which Diana had
descended too unexpectedly on her worshipper.  It was mortifying.  Will
was conscious that he should not have been at Middlemarch but for
Dorothea; and yet his position there was threatening to divide him from
her with those barriers of habitual sentiment which are more fatal to
the persistence of mutual interest than all the distance between Rome
and Britain.  Prejudices about rank and status were easy enough to defy
in the form of a tyrannical letter from Mr. Casaubon; but prejudices,
like odorous bodies, have a double existence both solid and subtle—solid
as the pyramids, subtle as the twentieth echo of an echo, or as
the memory of hyacinths which once scented the darkness.  And Will was
of a temperament to feel keenly the presence of subtleties: a man of
clumsier perceptions would not have felt, as he did, that for the first
time some sense of unfitness in perfect freedom with him had sprung up
in Dorothea's mind, and that their silence, as he conducted her to the
carriage, had had a chill in it.  Perhaps Casaubon, in his hatred and
jealousy, had been insisting to Dorothea that Will had slid below her
socially.  Confound Casaubon! </said>
</P>

<P>
Will re-entered the drawing-room, took up his hat, and looking
irritated as he advanced towards Mrs. Lydgate, who had seated herself
at her work-table, said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">It is always fatal to have music or poetry interrupted.  May I come
another day and just finish about the rendering of 'Lungi dal caro
bene'?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">I shall be happy to be taught,</said> said Rosamond.  <said who="#R">But I am sure you
admit that the interruption was a very beautiful one.  I quite envy
your acquaintance with Mrs. Casaubon.  Is she very clever?  She looks
as if she were.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Really, I never thought about it,</said> said Will, sulkily.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">That is just the answer Tertius gave me, when I first asked him if she
were handsome.  What is it that you gentlemen are thinking of when you
are with Mrs. Casaubon?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Herself,</said> said Will, not indisposed to provoke the charming Mrs.
Lydgate.  <said who="#Lad">When one sees a perfect woman, one never thinks of her
attributes—one is conscious of her presence.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">I shall be jealous when Tertius goes to Lowick,</said> said Rosamond,
dimpling, and speaking with aery lightness.  <said who="#R">He will come back and
think nothing of me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">That does not seem to have been the effect on Lydgate hitherto.  Mrs.
Casaubon is too unlike other women for them to be compared with her.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">You are a devout worshipper, I perceive.  You often see her, I
suppose.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">No,</said> said Will, almost pettishly.  <said who="#Lad">Worship is usually a matter of
theory rather than of practice.  But I am practising it to excess just
at this moment—I must really tear myself away.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Pray come again some evening: Mr. Lydgate will like to hear the music,
and I cannot enjoy it so well without him.</said>
</P>

<P>
When her husband was at home again, Rosamond said, standing in front of
him and holding his coat-collar with both her hands, <said who="#R">Mr. Ladislaw was
here singing with me when Mrs. Casaubon came in.  He seemed vexed.  Do
you think he disliked her seeing him at our house?  Surely your
position is more than equal to his—whatever may be his relation to the
Casaubons.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">No, no; it must be something else if he were really vexed. Ladislaw is
a sort of gypsy; he thinks nothing of leather and prunella.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Music apart, he is not always very agreeable.  Do you like him?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Yes: I think he is a good fellow: rather miscellaneous and
bric-a-brac, but likable.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Do you know, I think he adores Mrs. Casaubon.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Poor devil!</said> said Lydgate, smiling and pinching his wife's ears.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R" direct="false" aloud="false"> Rosamond felt herself beginning to know a great deal of the world,
especially in discovering what when she was in her unmarried girlhood
had been inconceivable to her except as a dim tragedy in by-gone
costumes—that women, even after marriage, might make conquests and
enslave men.  At that time young ladies in the country, even when
educated at Mrs. Lemon's, read little French literature later than
Racine, and public prints had not cast their present magnificent
illumination over the scandals of life.  Still, vanity, with a woman's
whole mind and day to work in, can construct abundantly on slight
hints, especially on such a hint as the possibility of indefinite
conquests.  How delightful to make captives from the throne of marriage
with a husband as crown-prince by your side—himself in fact a
subject—while the captives look up forever hopeless, losing their
rest probably, and if their appetite too, so much the better!  But
Rosamond's romance turned at present chiefly on her crown-prince, and
it was enough to enjoy his assured subjection. </said> When he said, <said who="#Lyd">Poor
devil!</said> she asked, with playful curiosity—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Why so?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R"> Why, what can a man do when he takes to adoring one of you mermaids?
He only neglects his work and runs up bills.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">I am sure you do not neglect your work.  You are always at the
Hospital, or seeing poor patients, or thinking about some doctor's
quarrel; and then at home you always want to pore over your microscope
and phials.  Confess you like those things better than me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Haven't you ambition enough to wish that your husband should be
something better than a Middlemarch doctor?</said> said Lydgate, letting his
hands fall on to his wife's shoulders, and looking at her with
affectionate gravity.  <said who="#Lyd">I shall make you learn my favorite bit from an
old poet—
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
'Why should our pride make such a stir to be<BR/>
And be forgot?  What good is like to this,<BR/>
To do worthy the writing, and to write<BR/>
Worthy the reading and the worlds delight?'<BR/>
</P>

<P>
<SAID who="#Lyd"> What I want, Rosy, is to do worthy the writing,—and to write out
myself what I have done.  A man must work, to do that, my pet.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Of course, I wish you to make discoveries: no one could more wish you
to attain a high position in some better place than Middlemarch.  You
cannot say that I have ever tried to hinder you from working.  But we
cannot live like hermits.  You are not discontented with me, Tertius?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">No, dear, no.  I am too entirely contented.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">But what did Mrs. Casaubon want to say to you?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Merely to ask about her husband's health.  But I think she is going to
be splendid to our New Hospital: I think she will give us two hundred
a-year.</said>

<P>
When Dorothea, walking round the laurel-planted plots of the New
Hospital with Lydgate, had learned from him that there were no signs of
change in Mr. Casaubon's bodily condition beyond the mental sign of
anxiety to know the truth about his illness, she was silent for a few
moments, wondering whether she had said or done anything to rouse this
new anxiety.  Lydgate, not willing to let slip an opportunity of
furthering a favorite purpose, ventured to say—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I don't know whether your or Mr. Casaubon's attention has been drawn
to the needs of our New Hospital.  Circumstances have made it seem
rather egotistic in me to urge the subject; but that is not my fault:
it is because there is a fight being made against it by the other
medical men.  I think you are generally interested in such things, for
I remember that when I first had the pleasure of seeing you at Tipton
Grange before your marriage, you were asking me some questions about
the way in which the health of the poor was affected by their miserable
housing.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Yes, indeed,</said> said Dorothea, brightening.  <said who="#D">I shall be quite grateful
to you if you will tell me how I can help to make things a little
better.  Everything of that sort has slipped away from me since I have
been married.  I mean,</said> she said, after a moment's hesitation, <said who="#D">that
the people in our village are tolerably comfortable, and my mind has
been too much taken up for me to inquire further.  But here—in such a
place as Middlemarch—there must be a great deal to be done.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">There is everything to be done,</said> said Lydgate, with abrupt energy.
<said who="#Lyd">And this Hospital is a capital piece of work, due entirely to Mr.
Bulstrode's exertions, and in a great degree to his money.  But one man
can't do everything in a scheme of this sort.  Of course he looked
forward to help.  And now there's a mean, petty feud set up against the
thing in the town, by certain persons who want to make it a failure.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">What can be their reasons?</said> said Dorothea, with naive surprise.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Chiefly Mr. Bulstrode's unpopularity, to begin with.  Half the town
would almost take trouble for the sake of thwarting him.  In this
stupid world most people never consider that a thing is good to be done
unless it is done by their own set.  I had no connection with Bulstrode
before I came here.  I look at him quite impartially, and I see that he
has some notions—that he has set things on foot—which I can turn to
good public purpose.  If a fair number of the better educated men went
to work with the belief that their observations might contribute to the
reform of medical doctrine and practice, we should soon see a change
for the better.  That's my point of view.  I hold that by refusing to
work with Mr. Bulstrode I should be turning my back on an opportunity
of making my profession more generally serviceable.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I quite agree with you,</said> said Dorothea, at once fascinated by the
situation sketched in Lydgate's words.  <said who="#D">But what is there against Mr.
Bulstrode?  I know that my uncle is friendly with him.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">People don't like his religious tone,</said> said Lydgate, breaking off
there.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">That is all the stronger reason for despising such an opposition,</said>
said Dorothea, looking at the affairs of Middlemarch by the light of
the great persecutions.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">To put the matter quite fairly, they have other objections to him:—he
is masterful and rather unsociable, and he is concerned with trade,
which has complaints of its own that I know nothing about.  But what
has that to do with the question whether it would not be a fine thing
to establish here a more valuable hospital than any they have in the
county?  The immediate motive to the opposition, however, is the fact
that Bulstrode has put the medical direction into my hands.  Of course
I am glad of that.  It gives me an opportunity of doing some good
work,—and I am aware that I have to justify his choice of me.  But the
consequence is, that the whole profession in Middlemarch have set
themselves tooth and nail against the Hospital, and not only refuse to
cooperate themselves, but try to blacken the whole affair and hinder
subscriptions.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">How very petty!</said> exclaimed Dorothea, indignantly.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I suppose one must expect to fight one's way: there is hardly anything
to be done without it.  And the ignorance of people about here is
stupendous.  I don't lay claim to anything else than having used some
opportunities which have not come within everybody's reach; but there
is no stifling the offence of being young, and a new-comer, and
happening to know something more than the old inhabitants.  Still, if I
believe that I can set going a better method of treatment—if I
believe that I can pursue certain observations and inquiries which may
be a lasting benefit to medical practice, I should be a base truckler
if I allowed any consideration of personal comfort to hinder me.  And
the course is all the clearer from there being no salary in question to
put my persistence in an equivocal light.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I am glad you have told me this, Mr. Lydgate,</said> said Dorothea,
cordially.  <said who="#D">I feel sure I can help a little.  I have some money, and
don't know what to do with it—that is often an uncomfortable thought
to me.  I am sure I can spare two hundred a-year for a grand purpose
like this.  How happy you must be, to know things that you feel sure
will do great good!  I wish I could awake with that knowledge every
morning.  There seems to be so much trouble taken that one can hardly
see the good of!</said>
</P>

<P>
There was a melancholy cadence in Dorothea's voice as she spoke these
last words.  But she presently added, more cheerfully, <said who="#D">Pray come to
Lowick and tell us more of this.  I will mention the subject to Mr.
Casaubon.  I must hasten home now.</said>
</P>

<P>
She did mention it that evening, and said that she should like to
subscribe two hundred a-year—she had seven hundred a-year as the
equivalent of her own fortune, settled on her at her marriage.<said who="#C" direct="false" aloud="false">  Mr.
Casaubon made no objection beyond a passing remark that the sum might
be disproportionate in relation to other good objects, but when
Dorothea in her ignorance resisted that suggestion, he acquiesced.  He
did not care himself about spending money, and was not reluctant to
give it.  If he ever felt keenly any question of money it was through
the medium of another passion than the love of material property. </said>
</P>

<P>
Dorothea told him that she had seen Lydgate, and recited the gist of
her conversation with him about the Hospital. Mr. Casaubon did not
question her further, but he felt sure that she had wished to know what
had passed between Lydgate and himself. <said who="#C">She knows that I know,</said> said
the ever-restless voice within; but that increase of tacit knowledge
only thrust further off any confidence between them.  He distrusted her
affection; and what loneliness is more lonely than distrust?

<P CLASS="intro">
It is the humor of many heads to extol the days of their
forefathers, and declaim against the wickedness of times
present. Which notwithstanding they cannot handsomely do,
without the borrowed help and satire of times past;
condemning the vices of their own times, by the expressions
of vices in times which they commend, which cannot but argue
the community of vice in both. Horace, therefore, Juvenal,
and Persius, were no prophets, although their lines did seem
to indigitate and point at our times.—SIR THOMAS BROWNE:
Pseudodoxia Epidemica.
</P>

<BR/>

<P>
That opposition to the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to
Dorothea was, like other oppositions, to be viewed in many different
lights.  He regarded it as a mixture of jealousy and dunderheaded
prejudice. <said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mr. Bulstrode saw in it not only medical jealousy but a
determination to thwart himself, prompted mainly by a hatred of that
vital religion of which he had striven to be an effectual lay
representative—a hatred which certainly found pretexts apart from
religion such as were only too easy to find in the entanglements of
human action.  These might be called the ministerial views.  But
oppositions have the illimitable range of objections at command, which
need never stop short at the boundary of knowledge, but can draw
forever on the vasts of ignorance. <said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> What the opposition in Middlemarch
said about the New Hospital and its administration had certainly a
great deal of echo in it, for heaven has taken care that everybody
shall not be an originator;</said> but there were differences which
represented every social shade between the polished moderation of Dr.
Minchin and the trenchant assertion of Mrs. Dollop, the landlady of the
Tankard in Slaughter Lane. </said>
</P>

<P>
<second> <said who="#MrsDollop" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mrs. Dollop became more and more convinced by her own asseveration,
that Dr. Lydgate meant to let the people die in the Hospital, if not to
poison them, for the sake of cutting them up without saying by your
leave or with your leave; for it was a known "fac" that he had wanted
to cut up Mrs. Goby, as respectable a woman as any in Parley Street,
who had money in trust before her marriage—a poor tale for a doctor,
who if he was good for anything should know what was the matter with
you before you died, and not want to pry into your inside after you
were gone. </second> If that was not reason, Mrs. Dollop wished to know what
was; but there was a prevalent feeling in her audience that her opinion
was a bulwark, and that if it were overthrown there would be no limits
to the cutting-up of bodies, as had been well seen in Burke and Hare
with their pitch-plaisters—such a hanging business as that was not
wanted in Middlemarch! </said>
</P>

<P>
And let it not be supposed that opinion at the Tankard in Slaughter
Lane was unimportant to the medical profession: that old authentic
public-house—the original Tankard, known by the name of Dollop's—was
the resort of a great Benefit Club, which had some months before put to
the vote whether its long-standing medical man, "Doctor Gambit" should
not be cashiered in favor of "this Doctor Lydgate", who was capable of
performing the most astonishing cures, and rescuing people altogether
given up by other practitioners.  But the balance had been turned
against Lydgate by two members, who for some private reasons held that
this power of resuscitating persons as good as dead was an equivocal
recommendation, and might interfere with providential favors.  In the
course of the year, however, there had been a change in the public
sentiment, of which the unanimity at Dollop's was an index.
</P>

<P>
A good deal more than a year ago, before anything was known of
Lydgate's skill, the judgments on it had naturally been divided,
depending on a sense of likelihood, situated perhaps in the pit of the
stomach or in the pineal gland, and differing in its verdicts, but not
the less valuable as a guide in the total deficit of evidence.
Patients who had chronic diseases or whose lives had long been worn
threadbare, like old Featherstone's, had been at once inclined to try
him; also, many who did not like paying their doctor's bills, thought
agreeably of opening an account with a new doctor and sending for him
without stint if the children's temper wanted a dose, occasions when
the old practitioners were often crusty; and all persons thus inclined
to employ Lydgate held it likely that he was clever. <second> Some considered
that he might do more than others where there was liver;—at least
there would be no harm in getting a few bottles of "stuff" from him,
since if these proved useless it would still be possible to return to
the Purifying Pills, which kept you alive if they did not remove the
yellowness.</second>  But these were people of minor importance.  Good
Middlemarch families were of course not going to change their doctor
without reason shown; and everybody who had employed Mr. Peacock did
not feel obliged to accept a new man merely in the character of his
successor, objecting that he was <said>not likely to be equal to Peacock.</said>
</P>

<P>
But Lydgate had not been long in the town before there were particulars
enough reported of him to breed much more specific expectations and to
intensify differences into partisanship; some of the particulars being
of that impressive order of which the significance is entirely hidden,
like a statistical amount without a standard of comparison, but with a
note of exclamation at the end.  The cubic feet of oxygen yearly
swallowed by a full-grown man—what a shudder they might have created
in some Middlemarch circles!  <said who="#unknown">Oxygen! nobody knows what that may
be—is it any wonder the cholera has got to Dantzic?  And yet there are
people who say quarantine is no good!</said>
</P>

<P>
One of the facts quickly rumored was that Lydgate did not dispense
drugs.  This was offensive both to the physicians whose exclusive
distinction seemed infringed on, and to the surgeon-apothecaries with
whom he ranged himself; and only a little while before, they might have
counted on having the law on their side against a man who without
calling himself a London-made M.D. dared to ask for pay except as a
charge on drugs.  But Lydgate had not been experienced enough to
foresee that his new course would be even more offensive to the laity;
and to Mr. Mawmsey, an important grocer in the Top Market, who, though
not one of his patients, questioned him in an affable manner on the
subject, he was injudicious enough to give a hasty popular explanation
of his reasons, pointing out to Mr. Mawmsey that it must lower the
character of practitioners, and be a constant injury to the public, if
their only mode of getting paid for their work was by their making out
long bills for draughts, boluses, and mixtures.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">It is in that way that hard-working medical men may come to be almost
as mischievous as quacks,</said> said Lydgate, rather thoughtlessly.  <said who="#Lyd">To get
their own bread they must overdose the king's lieges; and that's a bad
sort of treason, Mr. Mawmsey—undermines the constitution in a fatal
way.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Mawmsey was not only an overseer (it was about a question of
outdoor pay that he was having an interview with Lydgate), he was also
asthmatic and had an increasing family: thus, from a medical point of
view, as well as from his own, he was an important man; indeed, an
exceptional grocer, whose hair was arranged in a flame-like pyramid,
and whose retail deference was of the cordial, encouraging
kind—jocosely complimentary, and with a certain considerate abstinence
from letting out the full force of his mind.  It was Mr. Mawmsey's
friendly jocoseness in questioning him which had set the tone of
Lydgate's reply.  But let the wise be warned against too great
readiness at explanation: it multiplies the sources of mistake,
lengthening the sum for reckoners sure to go wrong.
</P>

<P>
Lydgate smiled as he ended his speech, putting his foot into the
stirrup, and Mr. Mawmsey laughed more than he would have done if he had
known who the king's lieges were, giving his <said who="#MrMawmsey">Good morning, sir,
good-morning, sir,</said> with the air of one who saw everything clearly
enough. <said who="#MrMawmsey" direct="false" aloud="false"> But in truth his views were perturbed.  For years he had been
paying bills with strictly made items, so that for every half-crown and
eighteen-pence he was certain something measurable had been delivered.
He had done this with satisfaction, including it among his
responsibilities as a husband and father, and regarding a longer bill
than usual as a dignity worth mentioning.  Moreover, in addition to the
massive benefit of the drugs to <said who="#MrMawmsey">self and family,</said> he had enjoyed the
pleasure of forming an acute judgment as to their immediate effects, so
as to give an intelligent statement for the guidance of Mr. Gambit—a
practitioner just a little lower in status than Wrench or Toller, and
especially esteemed as an accoucheur, of whose ability Mr. Mawmsey had
the poorest opinion on all other points, but in doctoring, he was wont
to say in an undertone, he placed Gambit above any of them.</said>
</P>

<P>
Here were deeper reasons than the superficial talk of a new man, which
appeared still flimsier in the drawing-room over the shop, when they
were recited to Mrs. Mawmsey, a woman accustomed to be made much of as
a fertile mother,—generally under attendance more or less frequent
from Mr. Gambit, and occasionally having attacks which required Dr.
Minchin.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrsMawmsey">Does this Mr. Lydgate mean to say there is no use in taking medicine?</said>
said Mrs. Mawmsey, who was slightly given to drawling.  <said who="#MrsMawmsey">I should like
him to tell me how I could bear up at Fair time, if I didn't take
strengthening medicine for a month beforehand.  Think of what I have to
provide for calling customers, my dear!"—here Mrs. Mawmsey turned to
an intimate female friend who sat by—"a large veal pie—a stuffed
fillet—a round of beef—ham, tongue, et cetera, et cetera!  But what
keeps me up best is the pink mixture, not the brown.  I wonder, Mr.
Mawmsey, with <emph rend="italics">your</emph> experience, you could have patience to listen.  I
should have told him at once that I knew a little better than that.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrMawmsey">No, no, no,</said> said Mr. Mawmsey; <said who="#MrMawmsey">I was not going to tell him my
opinion.  Hear everything and judge for yourself is my motto.  But he
didn't know who he was talking to.  I was not to be turned on <emph rend="italics">his</emph>
finger.  People often pretend to tell me things, when they might as
well say, 'Mawmsey, you're a fool.'  But I smile at it: I humor
everybody's weak place.  If physic had done harm to self and family, I
should have found it out by this time.</said>
</P>

<P>
The next day Mr. Gambit was told that Lydgate went about saying physic
was of no use.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrGambit">Indeed!</said> said he, lifting his eyebrows with cautious surprise.  (He
was a stout husky man with a large ring on his fourth finger.) <said who="#MrGambit">How
will he cure his patients, then?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrsMawmsey">That is what I say,</said> returned Mrs. Mawmsey, who habitually gave weight
to her speech by loading her pronouns.  <said who="#MrsMawmsey">Does <emph rend="italics">he</emph> suppose that people
will pay him only to come and sit with them and go away again?</said>
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Mawmsey had had a great deal of sitting from Mr. Gambit, including
very full accounts of his own habits of body and other affairs; but of
course he knew there was no innuendo in her remark, since his spare
time and personal narrative had never been charged for.  So he replied,
humorously—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrGambit">Well, Lydgate is a good-looking young fellow, you know.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrsMawmsey">Not one that I would employ,</said> said Mrs. Mawmsey.  <said who="#MrsMawmsey"><emph rend="italics">Others</emph> may do as
they please.</said>
</P>

<P>
Hence Mr. Gambit could go away from the chief grocer's without fear of
rivalry, but not without a sense that Lydgate was one of those
hypocrites who try to discredit others by advertising their own
honesty, and that it might be worth some people's while to show him up.
<said who="#MrGambit" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mr. Gambit, however, had a satisfactory practice, much pervaded by the
smells of retail trading which suggested the reduction of cash payments
to a balance.  And he did not think it worth his while to show Lydgate
up until he knew how.  He had not indeed great resources of education,
and had had to work his own way against a good deal of professional
contempt; but he made none the worse accoucheur for calling the
breathing apparatus <said>longs.</said> </said>
</P>

<P>
Other medical men felt themselves more capable.  Mr. Toller shared the
highest practice in the town and belonged to an old Middlemarch family:
there were Tollers in the law and everything else above the line of
retail trade. <first> Unlike our irascible friend Wrench, he had the easiest
way in the world of taking things which might be supposed to annoy him,
being a well-bred, quietly facetious man, who kept a good house, was
very fond of a little sporting when he could get it, very friendly with
Mr. Hawley, and hostile to Mr. Bulstrode. </first> It may seem odd that with
such pleasant habits he should have been given to the heroic treatment,
bleeding and blistering and starving his patients, with a dispassionate
disregard to his personal example; but the incongruity favored the
opinion of his ability among his patients, who commonly observed that
Mr. Toller had lazy manners, but his treatment was as active as you
could desire: no man, said they, carried more seriousness into his
profession: he was a little slow in coming, but when he came, he <emph rend="italics">did</emph>
something.  He was a great favorite in his own circle, and whatever he
implied to any one's disadvantage told doubly from his careless
ironical tone.
</P>

<P>
He naturally got tired of smiling and saying, <said who="#MrToller">Ah!</said> when he was told
that Mr. Peacock's successor did not mean to dispense medicines; and
Mr. Hackbutt one day mentioning it over the wine at a dinner-party, Mr.
Toller said, laughingly, <saidwho="#MrToller">Dibbitts will get rid of his stale drugs,
then.  I'm fond of little Dibbitts—I'm glad he's in luck.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hackbutt">I see your meaning, Toller,</said> said Mr. Hackbutt, <said who="#Hackbutt">and I am entirely of
your opinion.  I shall take an opportunity of expressing myself to that
effect.  A medical man should be responsible for the quality of the
drugs consumed by his patients.  That is the rationale of the system of
charging which has hitherto obtained; and nothing is more offensive
than this ostentation of reform, where there is no real amelioration.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrToller">Ostentation, Hackbutt?</said> said Mr. Toller, ironically.  <said who="#MrToller">I don't see
that.  A man can't very well be ostentatious of what nobody believes
in.  There's no reform in the matter: the question is, whether the
profit on the drugs is paid to the medical man by the druggist or by
the patient, and whether there shall be extra pay under the name of
attendance.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hawley">Ah, to be sure; one of your damned new versions of old humbug,</said> said
Mr. Hawley, passing the decanter to Mr. Wrench.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Wrench, generally abstemious, often drank wine rather freely at a
party, getting the more irritable in consequence.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Wrench">As to humbug, Hawley,</said> he said, <said who="#Wrench">that's a word easy to fling about.
But what I contend against is the way medical men are fouling their own
nest, and setting up a cry about the country as if a general
practitioner who dispenses drugs couldn't be a gentleman.  I throw back
the imputation with scorn.  I say, the most ungentlemanly trick a man
can be guilty of is to come among the members of his profession with
innovations which are a libel on their time-honored procedure.  That is
my opinion, and I am ready to maintain it against any one who
contradicts me.</said>  Mr. Wrench's voice had become exceedingly sharp.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hawley" >I can't oblige you there, Wrench,</said> said Mr. Hawley, thrusting his
hands into his trouser-pockets.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrToller">My dear fellow,</said> said Mr. Toller, striking in pacifically, and looking
at Mr. Wrench, <said who="#MrToller">the physicians have their toes trodden on more than we
have.  If you come to dignity it is a question for Minchin and Sprague.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hackbutt">Does medical jurisprudence provide nothing against these
infringements?</said> said Mr. Hackbutt, with a disinterested desire to offer
his lights.  <said who="#Hackbutt">How does the law stand, eh, Hawley?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hawley">Nothing to be done there,</said> said Mr. Hawley.  <said who="#Hawley">I looked into it for
Sprague.  You'd only break your nose against a damned judge's decision.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrToller">Pooh! no need of law,</said> said Mr. Toller.  <said who="#MrToller">So far as practice is
concerned the attempt is an absurdity.  No patient will like
it—certainly not Peacock's, who have been used to depletion.  Pass the
wine.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Toller's prediction was partly verified.  If Mr. and Mrs. Mawmsey,
who had no idea of employing Lydgate, were made uneasy by his supposed
declaration against drugs, it was inevitable that those who called him
in should watch a little anxiously to see whether he did <said>use all the
means he might use</said> in the case.  Even good Mr. Powderell, who in his
constant charity of interpretation was inclined to esteem Lydgate the
more for what seemed a conscientious pursuit of a better plan, had his
mind disturbed with doubts during his wife's attack of erysipelas, and
could not abstain from mentioning to Lydgate that Mr. Peacock on a
similar occasion had administered a series of boluses which were not
otherwise definable than by their remarkable effect in bringing Mrs.
Powderell round before Michaelmas from an illness which had begun in a
remarkably hot August.  At last, indeed, in the conflict between his
desire not to hurt Lydgate and his anxiety that no <said>means</said> should be
lacking, he induced his wife privately to take Widgeon's Purifying
Pills, an esteemed Middlemarch medicine, which arrested every disease
at the fountain by setting to work at once upon the blood.  This
co-operative measure was not to be mentioned to Lydgate, and Mr.
Powderell himself had no certain reliance on it, only hoping that it
might be attended with a blessing.
</P>

<P>
<first> But in this doubtful stage of Lydgate's introduction he was helped by
what we mortals rashly call good fortune. </first> <first> I suppose no doctor ever
came newly to a place without making cures that surprised somebody—cures
which may be called fortune's testimonials, and deserve as much
credit as the written or printed kind. </first> Various patients got well while
Lydgate was attending them, some even of dangerous illnesses; and it
was remarked that the new doctor with his new ways had at least the
merit of bringing people back from the brink of death. <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> The trash
talked on such occasions was the more vexatious to Lydgate, because it
gave precisely the sort of prestige which an incompetent and
unscrupulous man would desire, and was sure to be imputed to him by the
simmering dislike of the other medical men as an encouragement on his
own part of ignorant puffing.  But even his proud outspokenness was
checked by the discernment that it was as useless to fight against the
interpretations of ignorance as to whip the fog; and "good fortune"
insisted on using those interpretations. </said>
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Larcher having just become charitably concerned about alarming
symptoms in her charwoman, when Dr. Minchin called, asked him to see
her then and there, and to give her a certificate for the Infirmary;
whereupon after examination he wrote a statement of the case as one of
tumor, and recommended the bearer Nancy Nash as an out-patient. Nancy,
calling at home on her way to the Infirmary, allowed the stay maker and
his wife, in whose attic she lodged, to read Dr. Minchin's paper, and
by this means became a subject of compassionate conversation in the
neighboring shops of Churchyard Lane as being afflicted with a tumor at
first declared to be as large and hard as a duck's egg, but later in
the day to be about the size of "your fist". Most hearers agreed that
it would have to be cut out, but one had known of oil and another of
"squitchineal" as adequate to soften and reduce any lump in the body
when taken enough of into the inside—the oil by gradually "soopling",
the squitchineal by eating away.
</P>

<P>
Meanwhile when Nancy presented herself at the Infirmary, it happened to
be one of Lydgate's days there.  After questioning and examining her,
Lydgate said to the house-surgeon in an undertone, <said who="#Lyd">It's not tumor:
it's cramp.</said>  He ordered her a blister and some steel mixture, and told
her to go home and rest, giving her at the same time a note to Mrs.
Larcher, who, she said, was her best employer, to testify that she was
in need of good food.
</P>

<P>
But by-and-by Nancy, in her attic, became portentously worse, the
supposed tumor having indeed given way to the blister, but only
wandered to another region with angrier pain.  The staymaker's wife
went to fetch Lydgate, and he continued for a fortnight to attend Nancy
in her own home, until under his treatment she got quite well and went
to work again.  But the case continued to be described as one of tumor
in Churchyard Lane and other streets—nay, by Mrs. Larcher also; for
when Lydgate's remarkable cure was mentioned to Dr. Minchin, he
naturally did not like to say, <said who="#Minchin">The case was not one of tumor, and I
was mistaken in describing it as such,</said> but answered, <said who="#Minchin">Indeed! ah!  I
saw it was a surgical case, not of a fatal kind.</said> <said who="#Minchin" direct="false" aloud="false"> He had been inwardly
annoyed, however, when he had asked at the Infirmary about the woman he
had recommended two days before, to hear from the house-surgeon, a
youngster who was not sorry to vex Minchin with impunity, exactly what
had occurred: he privately pronounced that it was indecent in a general
practitioner to contradict a physician's diagnosis in that open manner,
and afterwards agreed with Wrench that Lydgate was disagreeably
inattentive to etiquette. </said> Lydgate did not make the affair a ground for
valuing himself or (very particularly) despising Minchin, such
rectification of misjudgments often happening among men of equal
qualifications.  But report took up this amazing case of tumor, not
clearly distinguished from cancer, and considered the more awful for
being of the wandering sort; till much prejudice against Lydgate's
method as to drugs was overcome by the proof of his marvellous skill in
the speedy restoration of Nancy Nash after she had been rolling and
rolling in agonies from the presence of a tumor both hard and
obstinate, but nevertheless compelled to yield.
</P>

<P>
How could Lydgate help himself? <second> It is offensive to tell a lady when
she is expressing her amazement at your skill, that she is altogether
mistaken and rather foolish in her amazement. </second> And to have entered into
the nature of diseases would only have added to his breaches of medical
propriety.  Thus he had to wince under a promise of success given by
that ignorant praise which misses every valid quality.
</P>

<P>
In the case of a more conspicuous patient, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull,
Lydgate was conscious of having shown himself something better than an
every-day doctor, though here too it was an equivocal advantage that he
won.  The eloquent auctioneer was seized with pneumonia, and having
been a patient of Mr. Peacock's, sent for Lydgate, whom he had
expressed his intention to patronize.  Mr Trumbull was a robust man, a
good subject for trying the expectant theory upon—watching the course
of an interesting disease when left as much as possible to itself, so
that the stages might be noted for future guidance; and from the air
with which he described his sensations Lydgate surmised that he would
like to be taken into his medical man's confidence, and be represented
as a partner in his own cure.  The auctioneer heard, without much
surprise, that his was a constitution which (always with due watching)
might be left to itself, so as to offer a beautiful example of a
disease with all its phases seen in clear delineation, and that he
probably had the rare strength of mind voluntarily to become the test
of a rational procedure, and thus make the disorder of his pulmonary
functions a general benefit to society.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Trumbull acquiesced at once, and entered strongly into the view
that an illness of his was no ordinary occasion for medical science.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrTrumbull">Never fear, sir; you are not speaking to one who is altogether
ignorant of the <i>vis medicatrix</i>,</said> said he, with his usual superiority of
expression, made rather pathetic by difficulty of breathing.  And he
went without shrinking through his abstinence from drugs, much
sustained by application of the thermometer which implied the
importance of his temperature, by the sense that he furnished objects
for the microscope, and by learning many new words which seemed suited
to the dignity of his secretions.  For Lydgate was acute enough to
indulge him with a little technical talk.
</P>

<P>
It may be imagined that Mr. Trumbull rose from his couch with a
disposition to speak of an illness in which he had manifested the
strength of his mind as well as constitution; and he was not backward
in awarding credit to the medical man who had discerned the quality of
patient he had to deal with.  The auctioneer was not an ungenerous man,
and liked to give others their due, feeling that he could afford it.
He had caught the words <said who="#MrTrumbull">expectant method,</said> and rang chimes on this and
other learned phrases to accompany the assurance that Lydgate <said who="#MrTrumbull">knew a
thing or two more than the rest of the doctors—was far better versed
in the secrets of his profession than the majority of his compeers.</said>
</P>

<P>
This had happened before the affair of Fred Vincy's illness had given
to Mr. Wrench's enmity towards Lydgate more definite personal ground.
<said who="#Wrench" direct="false" aloud="false"> The new-comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of
rivalry, and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical
criticism or reflections on his hard-driven elders, who had had
something else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions. </said> <second> His
practice had spread in one or two quarters, and from the first the
report of his high family had led to his being pretty generally
invited, so that the other medical men had to meet him at dinner in the
best houses; and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed
always to end in a mutual attachment. </second> There was hardly ever so much
unanimity among them as in the opinion that Lydgate was an arrogant
young fellow, and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to
show a crawling subservience to Bulstrode.  That Mr. Farebrother, whose
name was a chief flag of the anti-Bulstrode party, always defended
Lydgate and made a friend of him, was referred to Farebrother's
unaccountable way of fighting on both sides.
</P>

<P>
Here was plenty of preparation for the outburst of professional disgust
at the announcement of the laws Mr. Bulstrode was laying down for the
direction of the New Hospital, which were the more exasperating because
there was no present possibility of interfering with his will and
pleasure, everybody except Lord Medlicote having refused help towards
the building, on the ground that they preferred giving to the Old
Infirmary.  Mr. Bulstrode met all the expenses, and had ceased to be
sorry that he was purchasing the right to carry out his notions of
improvement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors; but he had
had to spend large sums, and the building had lingered. <second> Caleb Garth
had undertaken it, had failed during its progress, and before the
interior fittings were begun had retired from the management of the
business; and when referring to the Hospital he often said that however
Bulstrode might ring if you tried him, he liked good solid carpentry
and masonry, and had a notion both of drains and chimneys. </second> In fact,
the Hospital had become an object of intense interest to Bulstrode, and
he would willingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that he
might rule it dictatorially without any Board; but he had another
favorite object which also required money for its accomplishment: he
wished to buy some land in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, and
therefore he wished to get considerable contributions towards
maintaining the Hospital. <said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> Meanwhile he framed his plan of management.
The Hospital was to be reserved for fever in all its forms; <said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> Lydgate was
to be chief medical superintendent, that he might have free authority
to pursue all comparative investigations which his studies,
particularly in Paris, had shown him the importance of, the other
medical visitors having a consultative influence, but no power to
contravene Lydgate's ultimate decisions;</said> and the general management was
to be lodged exclusively in the hands of five directors associated with
Mr. Bulstrode, who were to have votes in the ratio of their
contributions, the Board itself filling up any vacancy in its numbers,
and no mob of small contributors being admitted to a share of
government. </said>
</P>

<P>
There was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man in the
town to become a visitor at the Fever Hospital.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Very well,</said> said Lydgate to Mr. Bulstrode, <said who="#Lyd">we have a capital
house-surgeon and dispenser, a clear-headed, neat-handed fellow; we'll
get Webbe from Crabsley, as good a country practitioner as any of them,
to come over twice a-week, and in case of any exceptional operation,
Protheroe will come from Brassing.  I must work the harder, that's all,
and I have given up my post at the Infirmary.  The plan will flourish
in spite of them, and then they'll be glad to come in.  Things can't
last as they are: there must be all sorts of reform soon, and then
young fellows may be glad to come and study here.</said>  Lydgate was in high
spirits.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">I shall not flinch, you may depend upon it, Mr. Lydgate,</said> said Mr.
Bulstrode.  <said who="#B">While I see you carrying out high intentions with vigor,
you shall have my unfailing support.  And I have humble confidence that
the blessing which has hitherto attended my efforts against the spirit
of evil in this town will not be withdrawn.  Suitable directors to
assist me I have no doubt of securing.  Mr. Brooke of Tipton has
already given me his concurrence, and a pledge to contribute yearly: he
has not specified the sum—probably not a great one.  But he will be a
useful member of the board.</said>
</P>

<P>
A useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would originate
nothing, and always vote with Mr. Bulstrode.
</P>

<P>
The medical aversion to Lydgate was hardly disguised now.  Neither Dr.
Sprague nor Dr. Minchin said that he disliked Lydgate's knowledge, or
his disposition to improve treatment: what they disliked was his
arrogance, which nobody felt to be altogether deniable.  They implied
that he was insolent, pretentious, and given to that reckless
innovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the
charlatan.
</P>

<P>
The word charlatan once thrown on the air could not be let drop.  In
those days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of Mr. St.
John Long, "noblemen and gentlemen" attesting his extraction of a fluid
like mercury from the temples of a patient.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Toller remarked one day, smilingly, to Mrs. Taft, that <said who="#MrToller">Bulstrode
had found a man to suit him in Lydgate; a charlatan in religion is sure
to like other sorts of charlatans.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrsTaft">Yes, indeed, I can imagine,</said> said Mrs. Taft, keeping the number of
thirty stitches carefully in her mind all the while; <said who="#MrsTaft">there are so many
of that sort.  I remember Mr. Cheshire, with his irons, trying to make
people straight when the Almighty had made them crooked.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrToller">No, no,</said> said Mr. Toller, <said who="#MrToller">Cheshire was all right—all fair and above
board.  But there's St. John Long—that's the kind of fellow we call a
charlatan, advertising cures in ways nobody knows anything about: a
fellow who wants to make a noise by pretending to go deeper than other
people.  The other day he was pretending to tap a man's brain and get
quicksilver out of it.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrsTaft">Good gracious! what dreadful trifling with people's constitutions!</said>
said Mrs. Taft.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MM" direct="false" aloud="false"> After this, it came to be held in various quarters that Lydgate played
even with respectable constitutions for his own purposes, and how much
more likely that in his flighty experimenting he should make sixes and
sevens of hospital patients.  Especially it was to be expected, as the
landlady of the Tankard had said, that he would recklessly cut up their
dead bodies. For Lydgate having attended Mrs. Goby, who died
apparently of a heart-disease not very clearly expressed in the
symptoms, too daringly asked leave of her relatives to open the body,
and thus gave an offence quickly spreading beyond Parley Street, where
that lady had long resided on an income such as made this association
of her body with the victims of Burke and Hare a flagrant insult to her
memory.</said>
</P>

<P>
Affairs were in this stage when Lydgate opened the subject of the
Hospital to Dorothea. <first>  We see that he was bearing enmity and silly
misconception with much spirit, aware that they were partly created by
his good share of success. </first>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">They will not drive me away,</said> he said, talking confidentially in Mr.
Farebrother's study.  <said who="#Lyd">I have got a good opportunity here, for the ends
I care most about; and I am pretty sure to get income enough for our
wants.  By-and-by I shall go on as quietly as possible: I have no
seductions now away from home and work.  And I am more and more
convinced that it will be possible to demonstrate the homogeneous
origin of all the tissues.  Raspail and others are on the same track,
and I have been losing time.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">I have no power of prophecy there,</said> said Mr. Farebrother, who had been
puffing at his pipe thoughtfully while Lydgate talked; <said who="#FB">but as to the
hostility in the town, you'll weather it if you are prudent.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">How am I to be prudent?</said> said Lydgate, <said who="#Lyd">I just do what comes before me
to do.  I can't help people's ignorance and spite, any more than
Vesalius could.  It isn't possible to square one's conduct to silly
conclusions which nobody can foresee.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Quite true; I didn't mean that.  I meant only two things.  One is,
keep yourself as separable from Bulstrode as you can: of course, you
can go on doing good work of your own by his help; but don't get tied.
Perhaps it seems like personal feeling in me to say so—and there's a
good deal of that, I own—but personal feeling is not always in the
wrong if you boil it down to the impressions which make it simply an
opinion.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Bulstrode is nothing to me,</said> said Lydgate, carelessly, <said who="#Lyd">except on
public grounds.  As to getting very closely united to him, I am not
fond enough of him for that.  But what was the other thing you meant?</said>
said Lydgate, who was nursing his leg as comfortably as possible, and
feeling in no great need of advice.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Why, this.  Take care—<i>experto crede</i>—take care not to get hampered
about money matters.  I know, by a word you let fall one day, that you
don't like my playing at cards so much for money.  You are right enough
there.  But try and keep clear of wanting small sums that you haven't
got.  I am perhaps talking rather superfluously; but a man likes to
assume superiority over himself, by holding up his bad example and
sermonizing on it.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> Lydgate took Mr. Farebrother's hints very cordially, though he would
hardly have borne them from another man.  He could not help remembering
that he had lately made some debts, but these had seemed inevitable,
and he had no intention now to do more than keep house in a simple way.
The furniture for which he owed would not want renewing; nor even the
stock of wine for a long while. </said>
</P>

<P>
Many thoughts cheered him at that time—and justly.  A man conscious of
enthusiasm for worthy aims is sustained under petty hostilities by the
memory of great workers who had to fight their way not without wounds,
and who hover in his mind as patron saints, invisibly helping.  At
home, that same evening when he had been chatting with Mr. Farebrother,
he had his long legs stretched on the sofa, his head thrown back, and
his hands clasped behind it according to his favorite ruminating
attitude, while Rosamond sat at the piano, and played one tune after
another, of which her husband only knew (<said who="#R" direct="false" aloud="false"> like the emotional elephant he
was! </said>) that they fell in with his mood as if they had been melodious
sea-breezes.
</P>

<P>
There was something very fine in Lydgate's look just then, and any one
might have been encouraged to bet on his achievement.  In his dark eyes
and on his mouth and brow there was that placidity which comes from the
fulness of contemplative thought—the mind not searching, but
beholding, and the glance seeming to be filled with what is behind it.
</P>

<P>
Presently Rosamond left the piano and seated herself on a chair close
to the sofa and opposite her husband's face.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Is that enough music for you, my lord?</said> she said, folding her hands
before her and putting on a little air of meekness.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Yes, dear, if you are tired,</said> said Lydgate, gently, turning his eyes
and resting them on her, but not otherwise moving.  Rosamond's presence
at that moment was perhaps no more than a spoonful brought to the lake,
and her woman's instinct in this matter was not dull.
</P>

<BR/>

<P>
<said who="#R">What is absorbing you?</said> she said, leaning forward and bringing her
face nearer to his.
</P>

<P>
He moved his hands and placed them gently behind her shoulders.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd"> I am thinking of a great fellow, who was about as old as I am three
hundred years ago, and had already begun a new era in anatomy.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">I can't guess,</said> said Rosamond, shaking her head.  <said who="#R">We used to play at
guessing historical characters at Mrs. Lemon's, but not anatomists.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I'll tell you.  His name was Vesalius.  And the only way he could get
to know anatomy as he did, was by going to snatch bodies at night, from
graveyards and places of execution.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Oh!</said> said Rosamond, with a look of disgust on her pretty face, <said who="#R">I am
very glad you are not Vesalius.  I should have thought he might find
some less horrible way than that.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">No, he couldn't,</said> said Lydgate, going on too earnestly to take much
notice of her answer.  <said who="#Lyd">He could only get a complete skeleton by
snatching the whitened bones of a criminal from the gallows, and
burying them, and fetching them away by bits secretly, in the dead of
night.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">I hope he is not one of your great heroes,</said> said Rosamond, half
playfully, half anxiously, <said who="#R">else I shall have you getting up in the
night to go to St. Peter's churchyard.  You know how angry you told me
the people were about Mrs. Goby.  You have enemies enough already.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">So had Vesalius, Rosy.  No wonder the medical fogies in Middlemarch
are jealous, when some of the greatest doctors living were fierce upon
Vesalius because they had believed in Galen, and he showed that Galen
was wrong.  They called him a liar and a poisonous monster.  But the
facts of the human frame were on his side; and so he got the better of
them.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">And what happened to him afterwards?</said> said Rosamond, with some
interest.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Oh, he had a good deal of fighting to the last.  And they did
exasperate him enough at one time to make him burn a good deal of his
work.  Then he got shipwrecked just as he was coming from Jerusalem to
take a great chair at Padua.  He died rather miserably.</said>
</P>

<P>
There was a moment's pause before Rosamond said, <said who="#R">Do you know, Tertius,
I often wish you had not been a medical man.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Nay, Rosy, don't say that,</said> said Lydgate, drawing her closer to him.
<said who="#Lyd">That is like saying you wish you had married another man.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Not at all; you are clever enough for anything: you might easily have
been something else.  And your cousins at Quallingham all think that
you have sunk below them in your choice of a profession.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">The cousins at Quallingham may go to the devil!</said> said Lydgate, with
scorn.  <said who="#Lyd">It was like their impudence if they said anything of the sort
to you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Still,</said> said Rosamond, <said who="#R">I do <emph rend="italics">not</emph> think it is a nice profession,
dear.</said>  We know that she had much quiet perseverance in her opinion.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">It is the grandest profession in the world, Rosamond,</said> said Lydgate,
gravely.  <said who="#Lyd">And to say that you love me without loving the medical man
in me, is the same sort of thing as to say that you like eating a peach
but don't like its flavor.  Don't say that again, dear, it pains me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Very well, Doctor Grave-face,</said> said Rosy, dimpling, <said who="#R">I will declare in
future that I dote on skeletons, and body-snatchers, and bits of things
in phials, and quarrels with everybody, that end in your dying
miserably.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">No, no, not so bad as that,</said> said Lydgate, giving up remonstrance and
petting her resignedly.
</P>

<P CLASS="intro">
Pues no podemos haber aquello que queremos, queramos
aquello que podremos.
<BR/><BR/>
Since we cannot get what we like, let us like
what we can get.—Spanish Proverb.
</P>

<BR/>

<P>
While Lydgate, safely married and with the Hospital under his command,
felt himself struggling for Medical Reform against Middlemarch,
Middlemarch was becoming more and more conscious of the national
struggle for another kind of Reform.
</P>

<P>
By the time that Lord John Russell's measure was being debated in the
House of Commons, there was a new political animation in Middlemarch,
and a new definition of parties which might show a decided change of
balance if a new election came.  And there were some who already
predicted this event, declaring that a Reform Bill would never be
carried by the actual Parliament.  This was what Will Ladislaw dwelt on
to Mr. Brooke as a reason for congratulation that he had not yet tried
his strength at the hustings.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Things will grow and ripen as if it were a comet year,</said> said Will.
<said who="#Lad">The public temper will soon get to a cometary heat, now the question
of Reform has set in.  There is likely to be another election before
long, and by that time Middlemarch will have got more ideas into its
head.  What we have to work at now is the 'Pioneer' and political
meetings.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Quite right, Ladislaw; we shall make a new thing of opinion here,</said>
said Mr. Brooke.  <said who="#MB">Only I want to keep myself independent about Reform,
you know; I don't want to go too far.  I want to take up
Wilberforce's and Romilly's line, you know, and work at Negro
Emancipation, Criminal Law—that kind of thing.  But of course I should
support Grey.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">If you go in for the principle of Reform, you must be prepared to take
what the situation offers,</said> said Will.  <said who="#Lad">If everybody pulled for his
own bit against everybody else, the whole question would go to tatters.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Yes, yes, I agree with you—I quite take that point of view.  I should
put it in that light.  I should support Grey, you know.  But I don't
want to change the balance of the constitution, and I don't think Grey
would.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">But that is what the country wants,</said> said Will.  <said who="#Lad">Else there would be
no meaning in political unions or any other movement that knows what
it's about.  It wants to have a House of Commons which is not weighted
with nominees of the landed class, but with representatives of the
other interests.  And as to contending for a reform short of that, it
is like asking for a bit of an avalanche which has already begun to
thunder.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">That is fine, Ladislaw: that is the way to put it.  Write that down,
now.  We must begin to get documents about the feeling of the country,
as well as the machine-breaking and general distress.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">As to documents,</said> said Will, <said who="#Lad">a two-inch card will hold plenty.  A few
rows of figures are enough to deduce misery from, and a few more will
show the rate at which the political determination of the people is
growing.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Good: draw that out a little more at length, Ladislaw.  That is an
idea, now: write it out in the 'Pioneer.' Put the figures and deduce
the misery, you know; and put the other figures and deduce—and so on.
You have a way of putting things.  Burke, now:—when I think of Burke,
I can't help wishing somebody had a pocket-borough to give you,
Ladislaw.  You'd never get elected, you know.  And we shall always want
talent in the House: reform as we will, we shall always want talent.
That avalanche and the thunder, now, was really a little like Burke.  I
want that sort of thing—not ideas, you know, but a way of putting
them.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Pocket-boroughs would be a fine thing,</said> said Ladislaw, <said who="#Lad">if they were
always in the right pocket, and there were always a Burke at hand.</said>
</P>

<P>
Will was not displeased with that complimentary comparison, even from
Mr. Brooke; for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be
conscious of expressing one's self better than others and never to have
it noticed, and in the general dearth of admiration for the right
thing, even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time is rather
fortifying. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> Will felt that his literary refinements were usually
beyond the limits of Middlemarch perception; nevertheless, he was
beginning thoroughly to like the work of which when he began he had
said to himself rather languidly, <said who="#Lad">Why not?</said>—and he studied the
political situation with as ardent an interest as he had ever given to
poetic metres or mediaevalism.  It is undeniable that but for the
desire to be where Dorothea was, and perhaps the want of knowing what
else to do, Will would not at this time have been meditating on the
needs of the English people or criticising English statesmanship: he
would probably have been rambling in Italy sketching plans for several
dramas, trying prose and finding it too jejune, trying verse and
finding it too artificial, beginning to copy <said who="#Lad"> bits</said> from old pictures,
leaving off because they were <said who="#Lad">no good,</said> and observing that, after all,
self-culture was the principal point; while in politics he would have
been sympathizing warmly with liberty and progress in general. </said> <first> Our
sense of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place
of dilettanteism and make us feel that the quality of our action is not
a matter of indifference. </first>
</P>

<P>
Ladislaw had now accepted his bit of work, though it was not that
indeterminate loftiest thing which he had once dreamed of as alone
worthy of continuous effort.  His nature warmed easily in the presence
of subjects which were visibly mixed with life and action, and the
easily stirred rebellion in him helped the glow of public spirit. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> In
spite of Mr. Casaubon and the banishment from Lowick, he was rather
happy; getting a great deal of fresh knowledge in a vivid way and for
practical purposes, and making the "Pioneer" celebrated as far as
Brassing (never mind the smallness of the area; the writing was not
worse than much that reaches the four corners of the earth). </said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Brooke was occasionally irritating; but Will's impatience was
relieved by the division of his time between visits to the Grange and
retreats to his Middlemarch lodgings, which gave variety to his life.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Shift the pegs a little,</said> he said to himself, <said who="#Lad">and Mr. Brooke might be
in the Cabinet, while I was Under-Secretary. That is the common order
of things: the little waves make the large ones and are of the same
pattern.  I am better here than in the sort of life Mr. Casaubon would
have trained me for, where the doing would be all laid down by a
precedent too rigid for me to react upon.  I don't care for prestige or
high pay.</said>
</P>

<P>
As Lydgate had said of him, he was a sort of gypsy, rather enjoying the
sense of belonging to no class; he had a feeling of romance in his
position, and a pleasant consciousness of creating a little surprise
wherever he went.  That sort of enjoyment had been disturbed when he
had felt some new distance between himself and Dorothea in their
accidental meeting at Lydgate's, and his irritation had gone out
towards Mr. Casaubon, who had declared beforehand that Will would lose
caste.  <said who="#Lad">I never had any caste,</said> he would have said, if that prophecy
had been uttered to him, and the quick blood would have come and gone
like breath in his transparent skin.  But it is one thing to like
defiance, and another thing to like its consequences.
</P>

<P>
Meanwhile, the town opinion about the new editor of the "Pioneer" was
tending to confirm Mr. Casaubon's view.  Will's relationship in that
distinguished quarter did not, like Lydgate's high connections, serve
as an advantageous introduction: if it was rumored that young Ladislaw
was Mr. Casaubon's nephew or cousin, it was also rumored that <said who="#MM">>Mr.
Casaubon would have nothing to do with him.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hawley">Brooke has taken him up,</said> said Mr. Hawley, <said who="#Hawley">because that is what no
man in his senses could have expected.  Casaubon has devilish good
reasons, you may be sure, for turning the cold shoulder on a young
fellow whose bringing-up he paid for.  Just like Brooke—one of those
fellows who would praise a cat to sell a horse.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Keck" direct="false" aloud="false"> And some oddities of Will's, more or less poetical, appeared to support
Mr. Keck, the editor of the "Trumpet" in asserting that Ladislaw, if
the truth were known, was not only a Polish emissary but crack-brained,
which accounted for the preternatural quickness and glibness of his
speech when he got on to a platform—as he did whenever he had an
opportunity, speaking with a facility which cast reflections on solid
Englishmen generally.  It was disgusting to Keck to see a strip of a
fellow, with light curls round his head, get up and speechify by the
hour against institutions </said> <said who="#Keck">which had existed when he was in his
cradle.</said>  And in a leading article of the "Trumpet", Keck characterized
Ladislaw's speech at a Reform meeting as <said who="#Keck">the violence of an
energumen—a miserable effort to shroud in the brilliancy of fireworks
the daring of irresponsible statements and the poverty of a knowledge
which was of the cheapest and most recent description.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Sprague">That was a rattling article yesterday, Keck,</said> said Dr. Sprague, with
sarcastic intentions.  <said who="#Sprague">But what is an energumen?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Keck">Oh, a term that came up in the French Revolution,</said> said Keck.
</P>

<P>
This dangerous aspect of Ladislaw was strangely contrasted with other
habits which became matter of remark.  He had a fondness, half
artistic, half affectionate, for little children—the smaller they were
on tolerably active legs, and the funnier their clothing, the better
Will liked to surprise and please them. <first> We know that in Rome he was
given to ramble about among the poor people, and the taste did not quit
him in Middlemarch. </first>
</P>

<P>
He had somehow picked up a troop of droll children, little hatless boys
with their galligaskins much worn and scant shirting to hang out,
little girls who tossed their hair out of their eyes to look at him,
and guardian brothers at the mature age of seven.  This troop he had
led out on gypsy excursions to Halsell Wood at nutting-time, and since
the cold weather had set in he had taken them on a clear day to gather
sticks for a bonfire in the hollow of a hillside, where he drew out a
small feast of gingerbread for them, and improvised a Punch-and-Judy
drama with some private home-made puppets.  Here was one oddity.
Another was, that in houses where he got friendly, he was given to
stretch himself at full length on the rug while he talked, and was apt
to be discovered in this attitude by occasional callers for whom such
an irregularity was likely to confirm the notions of his dangerously
mixed blood and general laxity.
</P>

<P>
But Will's articles and speeches naturally recommended him in families
which the new strictness of party division had marked off on the side
of Reform.  He was invited to Mr. Bulstrode's; but here he could not
lie down on the rug, and Mrs. Bulstrode felt that his mode of talking
about Catholic countries, as if there were any truce with Antichrist,
illustrated the usual tendency to unsoundness in intellectual men.
</P>

<P>
At Mr. Farebrother's, however, whom the irony of events had brought on
the same side with Bulstrode in the national movement, Will became a
favorite with the ladies; especially with little Miss Noble, whom it
was one of his oddities to escort when he met her in the street with
her little basket, giving her his arm in the eyes of the town, and
insisting on going with her to pay some call where she distributed her
small filchings from her own share of sweet things.
</P>

<P>
But the house where he visited oftenest and lay most on the rug was
Lydgate's. The two men were not at all alike, but they agreed none the
worse.  Lydgate was abrupt but not irritable, taking little notice of
megrims in healthy people; and Ladislaw did not usually throw away his
susceptibilities on those who took no notice of them. <said who="#R" direct="false" aloud="false"> With Rosamond,
on the other hand, he pouted and was wayward—nay, often
uncomplimentary, much to her inward surprise; nevertheless he was
gradually becoming necessary to her entertainment by his companionship
in her music, his varied talk, and his freedom from the grave
preoccupation which, with all her husband's tenderness and indulgence,
often made his manners unsatisfactory to her, and confirmed her dislike
of the medical profession. </said>
</P>

<P>
Lydgate, inclined to be sarcastic on the superstitious faith of the
people in the efficacy of "the bill", while nobody cared about the low
state of pathology, sometimes assailed Will with troublesome questions.
One evening in March, Rosamond in her cherry-colored dress with
swansdown trimming about the throat sat at the tea-table; Lydgate,
lately come in tired from his outdoor work, was seated sideways on an
easy-chair by the fire with one leg over the elbow, his brow looking a
little troubled as his eyes rambled over the columns of the "Pioneer",
while Rosamond, having noticed that he was perturbed, avoided looking
at him, and inwardly thanked heaven that she herself had not a moody
disposition. Will Ladislaw was stretched on the rug contemplating the
curtain-pole abstractedly, and humming very low the notes of <said>When
first I saw thy face;</said> while the house spaniel, also stretched out with
small choice of room, looked from between his paws at the usurper of
the rug with silent but strong objection.
</P>

<P>
Rosamond bringing Lydgate his cup of tea, he threw down the paper, and
said to Will, who had started up and gone to the table—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">It's no use your puffing Brooke as a reforming landlord, Ladislaw:
they only pick the more holes in his coat in the 'Trumpet.'</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">No matter; those who read the 'Pioneer' don't read the 'Trumpet,'</said>
said Will, swallowing his tea and walking about.  <said who="#Lad">Do you suppose the
public reads with a view to its own conversion?  We should have a
witches' brewing with a vengeance then—'Mingle, mingle, mingle,
mingle, You that mingle may'—and nobody would know which side he was
going to take.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Farebrother says, he doesn't believe Brooke would get elected if the
opportunity came: the very men who profess to be for him would bring
another member out of the bag at the right moment.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">There's no harm in trying.  It's good to have resident members.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Why?</said> said Lydgate, who was much given to use that inconvenient word
in a curt tone.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">They represent the local stupidity better,</said> said Will, laughing, and
shaking his curls; <said who="#Lad">and they are kept on their best behavior in the
neighborhood.  Brooke is not a bad fellow, but he has done some good
things on his estate that he never would have done but for this
Parliamentary bite.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">He's not fitted to be a public man,</said> said Lydgate, with contemptuous
decision.  <said who="#Lyd">He would disappoint everybody who counted on him: I can see
that at the Hospital.  Only, there Bulstrode holds the reins and drives
him.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">That depends on how you fix your standard of public men,</said> said Will.
<said who="#Lad">He's good enough for the occasion: when the people have made up their
mind as they are making it up now, they don't want a man—they only
want a vote.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">That is the way with you political writers, Ladislaw—crying up a
measure as if it were a universal cure, and crying up men who are a
part of the very disease that wants curing.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Why not?  Men may help to cure themselves off the face of the land
without knowing it,</said> said Will, who could find reasons impromptu, when
he had not thought of a question beforehand.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">That is no excuse for encouraging the superstitious exaggeration of
hopes about this particular measure, helping the cry to swallow it
whole and to send up voting popinjays who are good for nothing but to
carry it.  You go against rottenness, and there is nothing more
thoroughly rotten than making people believe that society can be cured
by a political hocus-pocus.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">That's very fine, my dear fellow.  But your cure must begin somewhere,
and put it that a thousand things which debase a population can never
be reformed without this particular reform to begin with.  Look what
Stanley said the other day—that the House had been tinkering long
enough at small questions of bribery, inquiring whether this or that
voter has had a guinea when everybody knows that the seats have been
sold wholesale.  Wait for wisdom and conscience in public
agents—fiddlestick!  The only conscience we can trust to is the
massive sense of wrong in a class, and the best wisdom that will work
is the wisdom of balancing claims.  That's my text—which side is
injured?  I support the man who supports their claims; not the virtuous
upholder of the wrong.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">That general talk about a particular case is mere question begging,
Ladislaw.  When I say, I go in for the dose that cures, it doesn't
follow that I go in for opium in a given case of gout.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I am not begging the question we are upon—whether we are to try for
nothing till we find immaculate men to work with.  Should you go on
that plan?  If there were one man who would carry you a medical reform
and another who would oppose it, should you inquire which had the
better motives or even the better brains?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Oh, of course,</said> said Lydgate, seeing himself checkmated by a move
which he had often used himself, <said who="#Lyd">if one did not work with such men as
are at hand, things must come to a dead-lock. Suppose the worst opinion
in the town about Bulstrode were a true one, that would not make it
less true that he has the sense and the resolution to do what I think
ought to be done in the matters I know and care most about; but that is
the only ground on which I go with him,</said> Lydgate added rather proudly,
bearing in mind Mr. Farebrother's remarks.  <said who="#Lyd">He is nothing to me
otherwise; I would not cry him up on any personal ground—I would keep
clear of that.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Do you mean that I cry up Brooke on any personal ground?</said> said Will
Ladislaw, nettled, and turning sharp round. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> For the first time he felt
offended with Lydgate; not the less so, perhaps, because he would have
declined any close inquiry into the growth of his relation to Mr. </said>
Brooke.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Not at all,</said> said Lydgate, <said who="#Lyd">I was simply explaining my own action.  I
meant that a man may work for a special end with others whose motives
and general course are equivocal, if he is quite sure of his personal
independence, and that he is not working for his private
interest—either place or money.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Then, why don't you extend your liberality to others?</said> said Will,
still nettled.  <said who="#Lad">My personal independence is as important to me as
yours is to you.  You have no more reason to imagine that I have
personal expectations from Brooke, than I have to imagine that you have
personal expectations from Bulstrode.  Motives are points of honor, I
suppose—nobody can prove them.  But as to money and place in the
world,</said> Will ended, tossing back his head, <said who="#Lad">I think it is pretty clear
that I am not determined by considerations of that sort.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">You quite mistake me, Ladislaw,</said> said Lydgate, surprised.  He had been
preoccupied with his own vindication, and had been blind to what
Ladislaw might infer on his own account.  <said who="#Lyd">I beg your pardon for
unintentionally annoying you.  In fact, I should rather attribute to
you a romantic disregard of your own worldly interests.  On the
political question, I referred simply to intellectual bias.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">How very unpleasant you both are this evening!</said> said Rosamond.  <said who="#R">I
cannot conceive why money should have been referred to.  Politics and
Medicine are sufficiently disagreeable to quarrel upon.  You can both
of you go on quarrelling with all the world and with each other on
those two topics.</said>
</P>

<P>
Rosamond looked mildly neutral as she said this, rising to ring the
bell, and then crossing to her work-table.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Poor Rosy!</said> said Lydgate, putting out his hand to her as she was
passing him.  <said who="#Lyd">Disputation is not amusing to cherubs.  Have some music.
Ask Ladislaw to sing with you.</said>
</P>

<P>
When Will was gone Rosamond said to her husband, <said who="#R">What put you out of
temper this evening, Tertius?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Me?  It was Ladislaw who was out of temper.  He is like a bit of
tinder.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">But I mean, before that.  Something had vexed you before you came in,
you looked cross.  And that made you begin to dispute with Mr.
Ladislaw.  You hurt me very much when you look so, Tertius.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Do I?  Then I am a brute,</said> said Lydgate, caressing her penitently.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">What vexed you?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Oh, outdoor things—business.</said>  It was really a letter insisting on
the payment of a bill for furniture.  But Rosamond was expecting to
have a baby, and Lydgate wished to save her from any perturbation.

        Was never true love loved in vain,
        For truest love is highest gain.
        No art can make it: it must spring

<BR/>

<P>
It happened to be on a Saturday evening that Will Ladislaw had that
little discussion with Lydgate.  Its effect when he went to his own
rooms was to make him sit up half the night, thinking over again, under
a new irritation, all that he had before thought of his having settled
in Middlemarch and harnessed himself with Mr. Brooke. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> Hesitations
before he had taken the step had since turned into susceptibility to
every hint that he would have been wiser not to take it; and hence came
his heat towards Lydgate—a heat which still kept him restless.  Was he
not making a fool of himself?—and at a time when he was more than
ever conscious of being something better than a fool?  And for what end? </said>
</P>

<P>
Well, for no definite end.  True, he had dreamy visions of
possibilities: there is no human being who having both passions and
thoughts does not think in consequence of his passions—does not find
images rising in his mind which soothe the passion with hope or sting
it with dread. <first> But this, which happens to us all, happens to some with
a wide difference; and Will was not one of those whose wit <said>keeps the
roadway:</said> he had his bypaths where there were little joys of his own
choosing, such as gentlemen cantering on the highroad might have
thought rather idiotic. </first> The way in which he made a sort of happiness
for himself out of his feeling for Dorothea was an example of this. <first> It
may seem strange, but it is the fact, that the ordinary vulgar vision
of which Mr. Casaubon suspected him—namely, that Dorothea might become
a widow, and that the interest he had established in her mind might
turn into acceptance of him as a husband—had no tempting, arresting
power over him; he did not live in the scenery of such an event, and
follow it out, as we all do with that imagined <said>otherwise</said> which is our
practical heaven. </first> It was not only that he was unwilling to entertain
thoughts which could be accused of baseness, and was already uneasy in
the sense that he had to justify himself from the charge of
ingratitude—the latent consciousness of many other barriers between
himself and Dorothea besides the existence of her husband, had helped
to turn away his imagination from speculating on what might befall Mr.
Casaubon.  And there were yet other reasons. <first> <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> Will, we know, could not
bear the thought of any flaw appearing in his crystal: he was at once
exasperated and delighted by the calm freedom with which Dorothea
looked at him and spoke to him, and there was something so exquisite in
thinking of her just as she was, that he could not long for a change
which must somehow change her. </said></first> <first> Do we not shun the street version of a
fine melody?—or shrink from the news that the rarity—some bit of
chiselling or engraving perhaps—which we have dwelt on even with
exultation in the trouble it has cost us to snatch glimpses of it, is
really not an uncommon thing, and may be obtained as an every-day
possession? </first> <first> Our good depends on the quality and breadth of our
emotion; and to Will, a creature who cared little for what are called
the solid things of life and greatly for its subtler influences, to
have within him such a feeling as he had towards Dorothea, was like the
inheritance of a fortune. </first> What others might have called the futility
of his passion, made an additional delight for his imagination: he was
conscious of a generous movement, and of verifying in his own
experience that higher love-poetry which had charmed his fancy.
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> Dorothea, he said to himself, was forever enthroned in his soul: no
other woman could sit higher than her footstool; and if he could have
written out in immortal syllables the effect she wrought within him, he
might have boasted after the example of old Drayton, </said>that,—
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<said>Queens hereafter might be glad to live<BR/>
Upon the alms of her superfluous praise."<BR/>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> But this result was questionable.  And what else could he do for
Dorothea?  What was his devotion worth to her?  It was impossible to
tell.  He would not go out of her reach.  He saw no creature among her
friends to whom he could believe that she spoke with the same simple
confidence as to him.  She had once said that she would like him to
stay; and stay he would, whatever fire-breathing dragons might hiss
around her. </said>
</P>

<P>
This had always been the conclusion of Will's hesitations.  But he was
not without contradictoriness and rebellion even towards his own
resolve. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> He had often got irritated, as he was on this particular
night, by some outside demonstration that his public exertions with Mr.
Brooke as a chief could not seem as heroic as he would like them to be,
and this was always associated with the other ground of
irritation—that notwithstanding his sacrifice of dignity for
Dorothea's sake, he could hardly ever see her. </said> Whereupon, not being
able to contradict these unpleasant facts, he contradicted his own
strongest bias and said, <said who="#Lad"> I am a fool.</said>
</P>

<P>
Nevertheless, since the inward debate necessarily turned on Dorothea,
he ended, as he had done before, only by getting a livelier sense of
what her presence would be to him; and suddenly reflecting that the
morrow would be Sunday, he determined to go to Lowick Church and see
her.  He slept upon that idea, but when he was dressing in the rational
morning light, Objection said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">That will be a virtual defiance of Mr. Casaubon's prohibition to visit
Lowick, and Dorothea will be displeased.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad"> Nonsense!</said> argued Inclination, <said who="#Lad">it would be too monstrous for him to
hinder me from going out to a pretty country church on a spring
morning.  And Dorothea will be glad.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">>It will be clear to Mr. Casaubon that you have come either to annoy
him or to see Dorothea.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">It is not true that I go to annoy him, and why should I not go to see
Dorothea?  Is he to have everything to himself and be always
comfortable?  Let him smart a little, as other people are obliged to
do.  I have always liked the quaintness of the church and congregation;
besides, I know the Tuckers: I shall go into their pew.</said>
</P>

<P>
Having silenced Objection by force of unreason, Will walked to Lowick
as if he had been on the way to Paradise, crossing Halsell Common and
skirting the wood, where the sunlight fell broadly under the budding
boughs, bringing out the beauties of moss and lichen, and fresh green
growths piercing the brown.  Everything seemed to know that it was
Sunday, and to approve of his going to Lowick Church.  Will easily felt
happy when nothing crossed his humor, and by this time the thought of
vexing Mr. Casaubon had become rather amusing to him, making his face
break into its merry smile, pleasant to see as the breaking of sunshine
on the water—though the occasion was not exemplary. <first> But most of us
are apt to settle within ourselves that the man who blocks our way is
odious, and not to mind causing him a little of the disgust which his
personality excites in ourselves. </first> Will went along with a small book
under his arm and a hand in each side-pocket, never reading, but
chanting a little, as he made scenes of what would happen in church and
coming out.  He was experimenting in tunes to suit some words of his
own, sometimes trying a ready-made melody, sometimes improvising.  The
words were not exactly a hymn, but they certainly fitted his Sunday
experience:—
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<said>O me, O me, what frugal cheer<BR/>
    My love doth feed upon!<BR/>
A touch, a ray, that is not here,<BR/>
    A shadow that is gone:<BR/>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"A dream of breath that might be near,<BR/>
    An inly-echoed tone,<BR/>
The thought that one may think me dear,<BR/>
    The place where one was known,<BR/>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"The tremor of a banished fear,<BR/>
     An ill that was not done—<BR/>
O me, O me, what frugal cheer<BR/>
    My love doth feed upon!"<BR/>
</P>

<P>
Sometimes, when he took off his hat, shaking his head backward, and
showing his delicate throat as he sang, he looked like an incarnation
of the spring whose spirit filled the air—a bright creature, abundant
in uncertain promises.
</P>

<P>
The bells were still ringing when he got to Lowick, and he went into
the curate's pew before any one else arrived there.  But he was still
left alone in it when the congregation had assembled. <first> The curate's pew
was opposite the rector's at the entrance of the small chancel, and
Will had time to fear that Dorothea might not come while he looked
round at the group of rural faces which made the congregation from year
to year within the white-washed walls and dark old pews, hardly with
more change than we see in the boughs of a tree which breaks here and
there with age, but yet has young shoots. </first> Mr. Rigg's frog-face was
something alien and unaccountable, but notwithstanding this shock to
the order of things, there were still the Waules and the rural stock of
the Powderells in their pews side by side; brother Samuel's cheek had
the same purple round as ever, and the three generations of decent
cottagers came as of old with a sense of duty to their betters
generally—the smaller children regarding Mr. Casaubon, who wore the
black gown and mounted to the highest box, as probably the chief of all
betters, and the one most awful if offended.  Even in 1831 Lowick was
at peace, not more agitated by Reform than by the solemn tenor of the
Sunday sermon.  The congregation had been used to seeing Will at church
in former days, and no one took much note of him except the choir, who
expected him to make a figure in the singing.
</P>

<P>
Dorothea did at last appear on this quaint background, walking up the
short aisle in her white beaver bonnet and gray cloak—the same she had
worn in the Vatican.  Her face being, from her entrance, towards the
chancel, even her shortsighted eyes soon discerned Will, but there was
no outward show of her feeling except a slight paleness and a grave bow
as she passed him.  To his own surprise Will felt suddenly
uncomfortable, and dared not look at her after they had bowed to each
other.  Two minutes later, when Mr. Casaubon came out of the vestry,
and, entering the pew, seated himself in face of Dorothea, Will felt
his paralysis more complete. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> He could look nowhere except at the choir
in the little gallery over the vestry-door: Dorothea was perhaps
pained, and he had made a wretched blunder.  It was no longer amusing
to vex Mr. Casaubon, who had the advantage probably of watching him and
seeing that he dared not turn his head.  Why had he not imagined this
beforehand?—but he could not expect that he should sit in that square
pew alone, unrelieved by any Tuckers, who had apparently departed from
Lowick altogether, for a new clergyman was in the desk.  Still he
called himself stupid now for not foreseeing that it would be
impossible for him to look towards Dorothea—nay, that she might feel
his coming an impertinence.  There was no delivering himself from his
cage, however; and Will found his places and looked at his book as if
he had been a school-mistress, feeling that the morning service had
never been so immeasurably long before, that he was utterly ridiculous,
out of temper, and miserable.  This was what a man got by worshipping
the sight of a woman! </said> The clerk observed with surprise that Mr.
Ladislaw did not join in the tune of Hanover, and reflected that he
might have a cold.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Casaubon did not preach that morning, and there was no change in
Will's situation until the blessing had been pronounced and every one
rose.  It was the fashion at Lowick for "the betters" to go out first.
With a sudden determination to break the spell that was upon him, Will
looked straight at Mr. Casaubon.  But that gentleman's eyes were on the
button of the pew-door, which he opened, allowing Dorothea to pass, and
following her immediately without raising his eyelids. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> Will's glance
had caught Dorothea's as she turned out of the pew, and again she
bowed, but this time with a look of agitation, as if she were
repressing tears. </said> Will walked out after them, but they went on towards
the little gate leading out of the churchyard into the shrubbery, never
looking round.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> It was impossible for him to follow them, and he could only walk back
sadly at mid-day along the same road which he had trodden hopefully in
the morning. </said> The lights were all changed for him both without and
within.
</P>

<BR/><BR/><BR/>

</div><div type="chapter" n="48"><head>CHAPTER XLVIII</head>

<epigraph>
        Surely the golden hours are turning gray
        And dance no more, and vainly strive to run:
        I see their white locks streaming in the wind—
        Each face is haggard as it looks at me,
        Slow turning in the constant clasping round
        Storm-driven.
</epigraph>

<BR/>

<P>
Dorothea's distress when she was leaving the church came chiefly from
the perception that Mr. Casaubon was determined not to speak to his
cousin, and that Will's presence at church had served to mark more
strongly the alienation between them.  Will's coming seemed to her
quite excusable, nay, she thought it an amiable movement in him towards
a reconciliation which she herself had been constantly wishing for.  He
had probably imagined, as she had, that if Mr. Casaubon and he could
meet easily, they would shake hands and friendly intercourse might
return.  But now Dorothea felt quite robbed of that hope. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> Will was
banished further than ever, for Mr. Casaubon must have been newly
embittered by this thrusting upon him of a presence which he refused to
recognize. </said>
</P>

<P>
He had not been very well that morning, suffering from some difficulty
in breathing, and had not preached in consequence; she was not
surprised, therefore, that he was nearly silent at luncheon, still less
that he made no allusion to Will Ladislaw.  For her own part she felt
that she could never again introduce that subject.  They usually spent
apart the hours between luncheon and dinner on a Sunday; Mr. Casaubon
in the library dozing chiefly, and Dorothea in her boudoir, where she
was wont to occupy herself with some of her favorite books.  There was
a little heap of them on the table in the bow-window—of various sorts,
from Herodotus, which she was learning to read with Mr. Casaubon, to
her old companion Pascal, and Keble's "Christian Year". But to-day she
opened one after another, and could read none of them. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> Everything
seemed dreary: the portents before the birth of Cyrus—Jewish
antiquities—oh dear!—devout epigrams—the sacred chime of favorite
hymns—all alike were as flat as tunes beaten on wood: even the spring
flowers and the grass had a dull shiver in them under the afternoon
clouds that hid the sun fitfully; even the sustaining thoughts which
had become habits seemed to have in them the weariness of long future
days in which she would still live with them for her sole companions. </said>
It was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor
Dorothea was hungering for, and the hunger had grown from the perpetual
effort demanded by her married life.  She was always trying to be what
her husband wished, and never able to repose on his delight in what she
was.  The thing that she liked, that she spontaneously cared to have,
seemed to be always excluded from her life; for if it was only granted
and not shared by her husband it might as well have been denied.  About
Will Ladislaw there had been a difference between them from the first,
and it had ended, since Mr. Casaubon had so severely repulsed
Dorothea's strong feeling about his claims on the family property, by
her being convinced that she was in the right and her husband in the
wrong, but that she was helpless.  This afternoon the helplessness was
more wretchedly benumbing than ever: she longed for objects who could
be dear to her, and to whom she could be dear.  She longed for work
which would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain, and
now it appeared that she was to live more and more in a virtual tomb,
where there was the apparatus of a ghastly labor producing what would
never see the light.  Today she had stood at the door of the tomb and
seen Will Ladislaw receding into the distant world of warm activity and
fellowship—turning his face towards her as he went.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> Books were of no use.  Thinking was of no use.  It was Sunday, and she
could not have the carriage to go to Celia, who had lately had a baby.
There was no refuge now from spiritual emptiness and discontent, and
Dorothea had to bear her bad mood, as she would have borne a headache. </said>
</P>

<P>
After dinner, at the hour when she usually began to read aloud, Mr.
Casaubon proposed that they should go into the library, where, he said,
he had ordered a fire and lights.  He seemed to have revived, and to be
thinking intently.
</P>

<P>
In the library Dorothea observed that he had newly arranged a row of
his note-books on a table, and now he took up and put into her hand a
well-known volume, which was a table of contents to all the others.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">You will oblige me, my dear,</said> he said, seating himself, <said who="#C">if instead of
other reading this evening, you will go through this aloud, pencil in
hand, and at each point where I say 'mark,' will make a cross with your
pencil.  This is the first step in a sifting process which I have long
had in view, and as we go on I shall be able to indicate to you certain
principles of selection whereby you will, I trust, have an intelligent
participation in my purpose.</said>
</P>

<P>
This proposal was only one more sign added to many since his memorable
interview with Lydgate, that Mr. Casaubon's original reluctance to let
Dorothea work with him had given place to the contrary disposition,
namely, to demand much interest and labor from her.
</P>

<P>
After she had read and marked for two hours, he said, <said who="#C">We will take the
volume up-stairs—and the pencil, if you please—and in case of
reading in the night, we can pursue this task.  It is not wearisome to
you, I trust, Dorothea?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I prefer always reading what you like best to hear,</said> said Dorothea,
who told the simple truth; for what she dreaded was to exert herself in
reading or anything else which left him as joyless as ever.
</P>

<P>
It was a proof of the force with which certain characteristics in
Dorothea impressed those around her, that her husband, with all his
jealousy and suspicion, had gathered implicit trust in the integrity of
her promises, and her power of devoting herself to her idea of the
right and best.  Of late he had begun to feel that these qualities were
a peculiar possession for himself, and he wanted to engross them.
</P>

<P>
The reading in the night did come.  Dorothea in her young weariness had
slept soon and fast: she was awakened by a sense of light, which seemed
to her at first like a sudden vision of sunset after she had climbed a
steep hill: she opened her eyes and saw her husband wrapped in his warm
gown seating himself in the arm-chair near the fire-place where the
embers were still glowing.  He had lit two candles, expecting that
Dorothea would awake, but not liking to rouse her by more direct means.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Are you ill, Edward?</said> she said, rising immediately.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">I felt some uneasiness in a reclining posture.  I will sit here for a
time.</said>  She threw wood on the fire, wrapped herself up, and said, <said who="#D">You
would like me to read to you?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">You would oblige me greatly by doing so, Dorothea,</said> said Mr. Casaubon,
with a shade more meekness than usual in his polite manner.  <said who="#C">I am
wakeful: my mind is remarkably lucid.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I fear that the excitement may be too great for you,</said> said Dorothea,
remembering Lydgate's cautions.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">No, I am not conscious of undue excitement.  Thought is easy.</said>
Dorothea dared not insist, and she read for an hour or more on the same
plan as she had done in the evening, but getting over the pages with
more quickness.  Mr. Casaubon's mind was more alert, and he seemed to
anticipate what was coming after a very slight verbal indication,
saying, <said who="#D">That will do—mark that</said>—or <said who="#C"> Pass on to the next head—I omit
the second excursus on Crete.</said> Dorothea was amazed to think of the
bird-like speed with which his mind was surveying the ground where it
had been creeping for years.  At last he said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">Close the book now, my dear.  We will resume our work to-morrow.  I
have deferred it too long, and would gladly see it completed.  But you
observe that the principle on which my selection is made, is to give
adequate, and not disproportionate illustration to each of the theses
enumerated in my introduction, as at present sketched.  You have
perceived that distinctly, Dorothea?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Yes,</said> said Dorothea, rather tremulously.  She felt sick at heart.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">And now I think that I can take some repose,</said> said Mr. Casaubon.  He
laid down again and begged her to put out the lights.  When she had
lain down too, and there was a darkness only broken by a dull glow on
the hearth, he said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">Before I sleep, I have a request to make, Dorothea.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">What is it?</said> said Dorothea, with dread in her mind.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">It is that you will let me know, deliberately, whether, in case of my
death, you will carry out my wishes: whether you will avoid doing what
I should deprecate, and apply yourself to do what I should desire.</said>
</P>

<P>
Dorothea was not taken by surprise: many incidents had been leading her
to the conjecture of some intention on her husband's part which might
make a new yoke for her.  She did not answer immediately.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">You refuse?</said> said Mr. Casaubon, with more edge in his tone.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">No, I do not yet refuse,</said> said Dorothea, in a clear voice, the need of
freedom asserting itself within her; <said who="#C">but it is too solemn—I think it
is not right—to make a promise when I am ignorant what it will bind me
to.  Whatever affection prompted I would do without promising.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">But you would use your own judgment: I ask you to obey mine; you
refuse.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">No, dear, no!</said> said Dorothea, beseechingly, crushed by opposing fears.
<said who="#D">But may I wait and reflect a little while?  I desire with my whole
soul to do what will comfort you; but I cannot give any pledge
suddenly—still less a pledge to do I know not what.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">You cannot then confide in the nature of my wishes?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Grant me till to-morrow,</said> said Dorothea, beseechingly.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C"> Till to-morrow then,</said> said Mr. Casaubon.
</P>

<P>
Soon she could hear that he was sleeping, but there was no more sleep
for her.  While she constrained herself to lie still lest she should
disturb him, her mind was carrying on a conflict in which imagination
ranged its forces first on one side and then on the other.  She had no
presentiment that the power which her husband wished to establish over
her future action had relation to anything else than his work.  But it
was clear enough to her that he would expect her to devote herself to
sifting those mixed heaps of material, which were to be the doubtful
illustration of principles still more doubtful.  The poor child had
become altogether unbelieving as to the trustworthiness of that Key
which had made the ambition and the labor of her husband's life.  It
was not wonderful that, in spite of her small instruction, her judgment
in this matter was truer than his: for she looked with unbiassed
comparison and healthy sense at probabilities on which he had risked
all his egoism.  And now she pictured to herself the days, and months,
and years which she must spend in sorting what might be called
shattered mummies, and fragments of a tradition which was itself a
mosaic wrought from crushed ruins—sorting them as food for a theory
which was already withered in the birth like an elfin child.  Doubtless
a vigorous error vigorously pursued has kept the embryos of truth
a-breathing: the quest of gold being at the same time a questioning of
substances, the body of chemistry is prepared for its soul, and
Lavoisier is born.  But Mr. Casaubon's theory of the elements which
made the seed of all tradition was not likely to bruise itself unawares
against discoveries: it floated among flexible conjectures no more
solid than those etymologies which seemed strong because of likeness in
sound until it was shown that likeness in sound made them impossible:
it was a method of interpretation which was not tested by the necessity
of forming anything which had sharper collisions than an elaborate
notion of Gog and Magog: it was as free from interruption as a plan for
threading the stars together. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false">  And Dorothea had so often had to check
her weariness and impatience over this questionable riddle-guessing, as
it revealed itself to her instead of the fellowship in high knowledge
which was to make life worthier!  She could understand well enough now
why her husband had come to cling to her, as possibly the only hope
left that his labors would ever take a shape in which they could be
given to the world.  At first it had seemed that he wished to keep even
her aloof from any close knowledge of what he was doing; but gradually
the terrible stringency of human need—the prospect of a too speedy
death— </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> And here Dorothea's pity turned from her own future to her husband's
past—nay, to his present hard struggle with a lot which had grown out
of that past: the lonely labor, the ambition breathing hardly under the
pressure of self-distrust; the goal receding, and the heavier limbs;
and now at last the sword visibly trembling above him!  And had she not
wished to marry him that she might help him in his life's labor?—But
she had thought the work was to be something greater, which she could
serve in devoutly for its own sake.  Was it right, even to soothe his
grief—would it be possible, even if she promised—to work as in a
treadmill fruitlessly? </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D"> And yet, could she deny him?  Could she say, <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false">I refuse to content this
pining hunger?</said>  It would be refusing to do for him dead, what she was
almost sure to do for him living.  If he lived as Lydgate had said he
might, for fifteen years or more, her life would certainly be spent in
helping him and obeying him.</said>
</P>

<P>
S<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> till, there was a deep difference between that devotion to the living
and that indefinite promise of devotion to the dead.  While he lived,
he could claim nothing that she would not still be free to remonstrate
against, and even to refuse.  But—the thought passed through her mind
more than once, though she could not believe in it—might he not mean
to demand something more from her than she had been able to imagine,
since he wanted her pledge to carry out his wishes without telling her
exactly what they were?  No; his heart was bound up in his work only:
that was the end for which his failing life was to be eked out by hers.</said>
</P>

<P>
And now, if she were to say, <said who="#D">No! if you die, I will put no finger to
your work</said>—it seemed as if she would be crushing that bruised heart.
</P>

<P>
For four hours Dorothea lay in this conflict, till she felt ill and
bewildered, unable to resolve, praying mutely.  Helpless as a child
which has sobbed and sought too long, she fell into a late morning
sleep, and when she waked Mr. Casaubon was already up.  Tantripp told
her that he had read prayers, breakfasted, and was in the library.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Tantripp"> I never saw you look so pale, madam,</said> said Tantripp, a solid-figured
woman who had been with the sisters at Lausanne.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Was I ever high-colored, Tantripp?</said> said Dorothea, smiling faintly.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Tantripp">Well, not to say high-colored, but with a bloom like a Chiny rose.
But always smelling those leather books, what can be expected?  Do rest
a little this morning, madam.  Let me say you are ill and not able to
go into that close library.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Oh no, no! let me make haste,</said> said Dorothea.  <said who="#D">Mr. Casaubon wants me
particularly.</said>
</P>

<P>
When she went down she felt sure that she should promise to fulfil his
wishes; but that would be later in the day—not yet.
</P>

<P>
As Dorothea entered the library, Mr. Casaubon turned round from the
table where he had been placing some books, and said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">I was waiting for your appearance, my dear.  I had hoped to set to
work at once this morning, but I find myself under some indisposition,
probably from too much excitement yesterday.  I am going now to take a
turn in the shrubbery, since the air is milder.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I am glad to hear that,</said> said Dorothea.  <said who="#D">Your mind, I feared, was too
active last night.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">I would fain have it set at rest on the point I last spoke of,
Dorothea.  You can now, I hope, give me an answer.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">May I come out to you in the garden presently?</said> said Dorothea, winning
a little breathing space in that way.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">I shall be in the Yew-tree Walk for the next half-hour,</said> said Mr.
Casaubon, and then he left her.
</P>

<P>
Dorothea, feeling very weary, rang and asked Tantripp to bring her some
wraps.  She had been sitting still for a few minutes, but not in any
renewal of the former conflict: she simply felt that she was going to
say <said who="#D">Yes</said> to her own doom: she was too weak, too full of dread at the
thought of inflicting a keen-edged blow on her husband, to do anything
but submit completely.  She sat still and let Tantripp put on her
bonnet and shawl, a passivity which was unusual with her, for she liked
to wait on herself.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Tantripp">God bless you, madam!</said> said Tantripp, with an irrepressible movement
of love towards the beautiful, gentle creature for whom she felt unable
to do anything more, now that she had finished tying the bonnet.
</P>

<P>
This was too much for Dorothea's highly-strung feeling, and she burst
into tears, sobbing against Tantripp's arm.  But soon she checked
herself, dried her eyes, and went out at the glass door into the
shrubbery.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Tantripp">I wish every book in that library was built into a caticom for your
master,</said> said Tantripp to Pratt, the butler, finding him in the
breakfast-room. <first> She had been at Rome, and visited the antiquities, as
we know; </first> and she always declined to call Mr. Casaubon anything but
<said who="#Tantripp">your master,</said> when speaking to the other servants.
</P>

<P>
Pratt laughed.  He liked his master very well, but he liked Tantripp
better.
</P>

<P>
When Dorothea was out on the gravel walks, she lingered among the
nearer clumps of trees, hesitating, as she had done once before, though
from a different cause.  Then she had feared lest her effort at
fellowship should be unwelcome; now she dreaded going to the spot where
she foresaw that she must bind herself to a fellowship from which she
shrank.  Neither law nor the world's opinion compelled her to
this—only her husband's nature and her own compassion, only the ideal
and not the real yoke of marriage.  She saw clearly enough the whole
situation, yet she was fettered: she could not smite the stricken soul
that entreated hers.  If that were weakness, Dorothea was weak. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false">  But
the half-hour was passing, and she must not delay longer. </said>  When she
entered the Yew-tree Walk she could not see her husband; but the walk
had bends, and she went, expecting to catch sight of his figure wrapped
in a blue cloak, which, with a warm velvet cap, was his outer garment
on chill days for the garden.  It occurred to her that he might be
resting in the summer-house, towards which the path diverged a little.
Turning the angle, she could see him seated on the bench, close to a
stone table.  His arms were resting on the table, and his brow was
bowed down on them, the blue cloak being dragged forward and screening
his face on each side.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">He exhausted himself last night,</said> Dorothea said to herself, thinking
at first that he was asleep, and that the summer-house was too damp a
place to rest in.  But then she remembered that of late she had seen
him take that attitude when she was reading to him, as if he found it
easier than any other; and that he would sometimes speak, as well as
listen, with his face down in that way.  She went into the summerhouse
and said, <said who="#D">I am come, Edward; I am ready.</said>
</P>

<P>
He took no notice, and she thought that he must be fast asleep.  She
laid her hand on his shoulder, and repeated, <said who="#D">I am ready!</said> Still he was
motionless; and with a sudden confused fear, she leaned down to him,
took off his velvet cap, and leaned her cheek close to his head, crying
in a distressed tone—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Wake, dear, wake!  Listen to me.  I am come to answer.</said> But Dorothea
never gave her answer.
</P>

<P>
Later in the day, Lydgate was seated by her bedside, and she was
talking deliriously, thinking aloud, and recalling what had gone
through her mind the night before.  She knew him, and called him by his
name, but appeared to think it right that she should explain everything
to him; and again, and again, begged him to explain everything to her
husband.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Tell him I shall go to him soon: I am ready to promise.  Only,
thinking about it was so dreadful—it has made me ill.  Not very ill.
I shall soon be better.  Go and tell him.</said>
</P>

<P>
But the silence in her husband's ear was never more to be broken.

</epigraph>

<BR/>

<P>
<said who="#JC">I wish to God we could hinder Dorothea from knowing this,</said> said Sir
James Chettam, with a little frown on his brow, and an expression of
intense disgust about his mouth.
</P>

<P>
He was standing on the hearth-rug in the library at Lowick Grange, and
speaking to Mr. Brooke.  It was the day after Mr. Casaubon had been
buried, and Dorothea was not yet able to leave her room.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">That would be difficult, you know, Chettam, as she is an executrix,
and she likes to go into these things—property, land, that kind of
thing.  She has her notions, you know,</said> said Mr. Brooke, sticking his
eye-glasses on nervously, and exploring the edges of a folded paper
which he held in his hand; <said who="#MB">and she would like to act—depend upon it,
as an executrix Dorothea would want to act.  And she was twenty-one
last December, you know.  I can hinder nothing.</said>
</P>

<P>
Sir James looked at the carpet for a minute in silence, and then
lifting his eyes suddenly fixed them on Mr. Brooke, saying, <said who="#JC">I will
tell you what we can do.  Until Dorothea is well, all business must be
kept from her, and as soon as she is able to be moved she must come to
us.  Being with Celia and the baby will be the best thing in the world
for her, and will pass away the time.  And meanwhile you must get rid
of Ladislaw: you must send him out of the country.</said> Here Sir James's
look of disgust returned in all its intensity.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Brooke put his hands behind him, walked to the window and
straightened his back with a little shake before he replied.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">That is easily said, Chettam, easily said, you know.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC">My dear sir,</said> persisted Sir James, restraining his indignation within
respectful forms, <said who="#JC">it was you who brought him here, and you who keep
him here—I mean by the occupation you give him.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Yes, but I can't dismiss him in an instant without assigning reasons,
my dear Chettam.  Ladislaw has been invaluable, most satisfactory.  I
consider that I have done this part of the country a service by
bringing him—by bringing him, you know.</said>  Mr. Brooke ended with a nod,
turning round to give it.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC">It's a pity this part of the country didn't do without him, that's all
I have to say about it.  At any rate, as Dorothea's brother-in-law, I
feel warranted in objecting strongly to his being kept here by any
action on the part of her friends.  You admit, I hope, that I have a
right to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife's sister?</said>
</P>

<P>
Sir James was getting warm.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Of course, my dear Chettam, of course.  But you and I have different
ideas—different—</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC">Not about this action of Casaubon's, I should hope,</said> interrupted Sir
James.  <said who="#JC">I say that he has most unfairly compromised Dorothea.  I say
that there never was a meaner, more ungentlemanly action than this—a
codicil of this sort to a will which he made at the time of his
marriage with the knowledge and reliance of her family—a positive
insult to Dorothea!</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Well, you know, Casaubon was a little twisted about Ladislaw.
Ladislaw has told me the reason—dislike of the bent he took, you
know—Ladislaw didn't think much of Casaubon's notions, Thoth and
Dagon—that sort of thing: and I fancy that Casaubon didn't like the
independent position Ladislaw had taken up.  I saw the letters between
them, you know.  Poor Casaubon was a little buried in books—he didn't
know the world.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC">It's all very well for Ladislaw to put that color on it,</said> said Sir
James.  <said who="#JC"> But I believe Casaubon was only jealous of him on Dorothea's
account, and the world will suppose that she gave him some reason; and
that is what makes it so abominable—coupling her name with this young
fellow's.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">My dear Chettam, it won't lead to anything, you know,</said> said Mr.
Brooke, seating himself and sticking on his eye-glass again.  <said who="#MB">It's all
of a piece with Casaubon's oddity.  This paper, now, 'Synoptical
Tabulation' and so on, 'for the use of Mrs. Casaubon,' it was locked up
in the desk with the will.  I suppose he meant Dorothea to publish his
researches, eh? and she'll do it, you know; she has gone into his
studies uncommonly.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC">My dear sir,</said> said Sir James, impatiently, <said who="#JC">that is neither here nor
there.  The question is, whether you don't see with me the propriety of
sending young Ladislaw away?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Well, no, not the urgency of the thing.  By-and-by, perhaps, it may
come round.  As to gossip, you know, sending him away won't hinder
gossip.  People say what they like to say, not what they have chapter
and verse for,</said> said Mr Brooke, becoming acute about the truths that
lay on the side of his own wishes.  <said who="#MB">I might get rid of Ladislaw up to
a certain point—take away the 'Pioneer' from him, and that sort of
thing; but I couldn't send him out of the country if he didn't choose
to go—didn't choose, you know.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mr. Brooke, persisting as quietly as if he were only discussing the
nature of last year's weather, and nodding at the end with his usual
amenity, was an exasperating form of obstinacy. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC">Good God!</said> said Sir James, with as much passion as he ever showed,
<said who="#JC">let us get him a post; let us spend money on him.  If he could go in
the suite of some Colonial Governor!  Grampus might take him—and I
could write to Fulke about it.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">But Ladislaw won't be shipped off like a head of cattle, my dear
fellow; Ladislaw has his ideas.  It's my opinion that if he were to
part from me to-morrow, you'd only hear the more of him in the country.
With his talent for speaking and drawing up documents, there are few
men who could come up to him as an agitator—an agitator, you know.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC">Agitator!</said> said Sir James, with bitter emphasis, feeling that the
syllables of this word properly repeated were a sufficient exposure of
its hatefulness.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">But be reasonable, Chettam.  Dorothea, now.  As you say, she had
better go to Celia as soon as possible.  She can stay under your roof,
and in the mean time things may come round quietly.  Don't let us be
firing off our guns in a hurry, you know.  Standish will keep our
counsel, and the news will be old before it's known.  Twenty things may
happen to carry off Ladislaw—without my doing anything, you know.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC">Then I am to conclude that you decline to do anything?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Decline, Chettam?—no—I didn't say decline.  But I really don't see
what I could do.  Ladislaw is a gentleman.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC">I am glad to hear it!</said> said Sir James, his irritation making him
forget himself a little.  <said who="#JC">I am sure Casaubon was not.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Well, it would have been worse if he had made the codicil to hinder
her from marrying again at all, you know.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC">I don't know that,</said> said Sir James.  <said who="#JC">It would have been less
indelicate.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">One of poor Casaubon's freaks!  That attack upset his brain a little.
It all goes for nothing.  She doesn't <emph rend="italics">want</emph> to marry Ladislaw.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC">But this codicil is framed so as to make everybody believe that she
did.  I don't believe anything of the sort about Dorothea,</said> said Sir
James—then frowningly, <said who="#JC">but I suspect Ladislaw.  I tell you frankly,
I suspect Ladislaw.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">I couldn't take any immediate action on that ground, Chettam.  In
fact, if it were possible to pack him off—send him to Norfolk
Island—that sort of thing—it would look all the worse for Dorothea
to those who knew about it.  It would seem as if we distrusted
her—distrusted her, you know.</said>
</P>

<P>
That Mr. Brooke had hit on an undeniable argument, did not tend to
soothe Sir James.  He put out his hand to reach his hat, implying that
he did not mean to contend further, and said, still with some heat—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC">Well, I can only say that I think Dorothea was sacrificed once,
because her friends were too careless.  I shall do what I can, as her
brother, to protect her now.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">You can't do better than get her to Freshitt as soon as possible,
Chettam.  I approve that plan altogether,</said> said Mr. Brooke, well
pleased that he had won the argument. <said who="#MB" direct="false" aloud="false"> It would have been highly
inconvenient to him to part with Ladislaw at that time, when a
dissolution might happen any day, and electors were to be convinced of
the course by which the interests of the country would be best served. </said>
Mr. Brooke sincerely believed that this end could be secured by his own
return to Parliament: he offered the forces of his mind honestly to the
nation.

<P>
Dorothea had been safe at Freshitt Hall nearly a week before she had
asked any dangerous questions.  Every morning now she sat with Celia in
the prettiest of up-stairs sitting-rooms, opening into a small
conservatory—Celia all in white and lavender like a bunch of mixed
violets, watching the remarkable acts of the baby, which were so
dubious to her inexperienced mind that all conversation was interrupted
by appeals for their interpretation made to the oracular nurse.
<said who="#Celia" direct="false" aloud="false"> Dorothea sat by in her widow's dress, with an expression which rather
provoked Celia, as being much too sad; for not only was baby quite
well, but really when a husband had been so dull and troublesome while
he lived, and besides that had—well, well! </said> Sir James, of course, had
told Celia everything, with a strong representation how important it
was that Dorothea should not know it sooner than was inevitable.
</P>

<P>
But Mr. Brooke had been right in predicting that Dorothea would not
long remain passive where action had been assigned to her; she knew the
purport of her husband's will made at the time of their marriage, and
her mind, as soon as she was clearly conscious of her position, was
silently occupied with what she ought to do as the owner of Lowick
Manor with the patronage of the living attached to it.
</P>

<P>
One morning when her uncle paid his usual visit, though with an unusual
alacrity in his manner which he accounted for by saying that it was now
pretty certain Parliament would be dissolved forthwith, Dorothea said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Uncle, it is right now that I should consider who is to have the
living at Lowick.  After Mr. Tucker had been provided for, I never
heard my husband say that he had any clergyman in his mind as a
successor to himself.  I think I ought to have the keys now and go to
Lowick to examine all my husband's papers.  There may be something that
would throw light on his wishes.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">No hurry, my dear,</said> said Mr. Brooke, quietly.  <said who="#MB">By-and-by, you know,
you can go, if you like.  But I cast my eyes over things in the desks
and drawers—there was nothing—nothing but deep subjects, you
know—besides the will.  Everything can be done by-and-by. As to the
living, I have had an application for interest already—I should say
rather good.  Mr. Tyke has been strongly recommended to me—I had
something to do with getting him an appointment before.  An apostolic
man, I believe—the sort of thing that would suit you, my dear.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I should like to have fuller knowledge about him, uncle, and judge for
myself, if Mr. Casaubon has not left any expression of his wishes.  He
has perhaps made some addition to his will—there may be some
instructions for me,</said> said Dorothea, who had all the while had this
conjecture in her mind with relation to her husband's work.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Nothing about the rectory, my dear—nothing,</said> said Mr. Brooke, rising
to go away, and putting out his hand to his nieces: <said who="#MB">nor about his
researches, you know.  Nothing in the will.</said>
</P>

<P>
Dorothea's lip quivered.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Come, you must not think of these things yet, my dear.  By-and-by, you
know.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I am quite well now, uncle; I wish to exert myself.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Well, well, we shall see.  But I must run away now—I have no end of
work now—it's a crisis—a political crisis, you know.  And here is
Celia and her little man—you are an aunt, you know, now, and I am a
sort of grandfather,</said> said Mr. Brooke, <said who="#MB" direct="false" aloud="false"> with placid hurry, anxious to
get away and tell Chettam that it would not be his (Mr. Brooke's) fault
if Dorothea insisted on looking into everything. </said>
</P>

<P>
Dorothea sank back in her chair when her uncle had left the room, and
cast her eyes down meditatively on her crossed hands.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Celia">Look, Dodo! look at him!  Did you ever see anything like that?</said> said
Celia, in her comfortable staccato.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">What, Kitty?</said> said Dorothea, lifting her eyes rather absently.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Celia">What? why, his upper lip; see how he is drawing it down, as if he
meant to make a face.  Isn't it wonderful!  He may have his little
thoughts.  I wish nurse were here.  Do look at him.</said>
</P>

<P>
A large tear which had been for some time gathering, rolled down
Dorothea's cheek as she looked up and tried to smile.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Celia">Don't be sad, Dodo; kiss baby.  What are you brooding over so?  I am
sure you did everything, and a great deal too much.  You should be
happy now.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I wonder if Sir James would drive me to Lowick.  I want to look over
everything—to see if there were any words written for me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Celia">You are not to go till Mr. Lydgate says you may go.  And he has not
said so yet (here you are, nurse; take baby and walk up and down the
gallery). Besides, you have got a wrong notion in your head as usual,
Dodo—I can see that: it vexes me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Where am I wrong, Kitty?</said> said Dorothea, quite meekly.  She was almost
ready now to think Celia wiser than herself, and was really wondering
with some fear what her wrong notion was. <said who="#Celia" direct="false" aloud="false"> Celia felt her advantage,
and was determined to use it.  None of them knew Dodo as well as she
did, or knew how to manage her.  Since Celia's baby was born, she had
had a new sense of her mental solidity and calm wisdom.  It seemed
clear that where there was a baby, things were right enough, and that
error, in general, was a mere lack of that central poising force. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Celia">I can see what you are thinking of as well as can be, Dodo,</said> said
Celia.  <said who="#Celia">You are wanting to find out if there is anything uncomfortable
for you to do now, only because Mr. Casaubon wished it.  As if you had
not been uncomfortable enough before.  And he doesn't deserve it, and
you will find that out.  He has behaved very badly.  James is as angry
with him as can be.  And I had better tell you, to prepare you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Celia,</said> said Dorothea, entreatingly, <said who="#D">you distress me.  Tell me at
once what you mean.</said> <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> It glanced through her mind that Mr. Casaubon
had left the property away from her—which would not be so very
distressing. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Celia">Why, he has made a codicil to his will, to say the property was all to
go away from you if you married—I mean—</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">That is of no consequence,</said> said Dorothea, breaking in impetuously.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Celia">But if you married Mr. Ladislaw, not anybody else,</said> Celia went on with
persevering quietude.  <said who="#Celia">Of course that is of no consequence in one
way—you never <emph rend="italics">would</emph> marry Mr. Ladislaw; but that only makes it worse
of Mr. Casaubon.</said>
</P>

<P>
The blood rushed to Dorothea's face and neck painfully. <said who="#Celia" direct="false" aloud="false">  But Celia was
administering what she thought a sobering dose of fact.  It was taking
up notions that had done Dodo's health so much harm. </said>  So she went on in
her neutral tone, as if she had been remarking on baby's robes.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Celia">James says so.  He says it is abominable, and not like a gentleman.
And there never was a better judge than James.  It is as if Mr.
Casaubon wanted to make people believe that you would wish to marry Mr.
Ladislaw—which is ridiculous.  Only James says it was to hinder Mr.
Ladislaw from wanting to marry you for your money—just as if he ever
would think of making you an offer.  Mrs. Cadwallader said you might as
well marry an Italian with white mice!  But I must just go and look at
baby,</said> Celia added, without the least change of tone, throwing a light
shawl over her, and tripping away.
</P>

<P>
Dorothea by this time had turned cold again, and now threw herself back
helplessly in her chair.  She might have compared her experience at
that moment to the vague, alarmed consciousness that her life was
taking on a new form, that she was undergoing a metamorphosis in which
memory would not adjust itself to the stirring of new organs.
Everything was changing its aspect: her husband's conduct, her own
duteous feeling towards him, every struggle between them—and yet
more, her whole relation to Will Ladislaw.  Her world was in a state of
convulsive change; the only thing she could say distinctly to herself
was, that she must wait and think anew.  One change terrified her as if
it had been a sin; it was a violent shock of repulsion from her
departed husband, who had had hidden thoughts, perhaps perverting
everything she said and did.  Then again she was conscious of another
change which also made her tremulous; it was a sudden strange yearning
of heart towards Will Ladislaw.  It had never before entered her mind
that he could, under any circumstances, be her lover: conceive the
effect of the sudden revelation that another had thought of him in that
light—that perhaps he himself had been conscious of such a
possibility,—and this with the hurrying, crowding vision of unfitting
conditions, and questions not soon to be solved.
</P>

<P>
It seemed a long while—she did not know how long—before she heard
Celia saying, <said who="#Celia">That will do, nurse; he will be quiet on my lap now.
You can go to lunch, and let Garratt stay in the next room. What I
think, Dodo,</said> Celia went on, observing nothing more than that Dorothea
was leaning back in her chair, and likely to be passive, <said who="#Celia">is that Mr.
Casaubon was spiteful.  I never did like him, and James never did.  I
think the corners of his mouth were dreadfully spiteful.  And now he
has behaved in this way, I am sure religion does not require you to
make yourself uncomfortable about him.  If he has been taken away, that
is a mercy, and you ought to be grateful. We should not grieve, should
we, baby?</said> said <said who="#Celia" direct="false" aloud="false"> Celia confidentially to that unconscious centre and
poise of the world, who had the most remarkable fists all complete even
to the nails, and hair enough, really, when you took his cap off, to
make—you didn't know what:—in short, he was Bouddha in a Western
form. </said>
</P>

<P>
At this crisis Lydgate was announced, and one of the first things he
said was, <said who="#Lyd">I fear you are not so well as you were, Mrs. Casaubon; have
you been agitated? allow me to feel your pulse.</said>  Dorothea's hand was
of a marble coldness.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Celia">She wants to go to Lowick, to look over papers,</said> said Celia.  <said who="#Celia">She
ought not, ought she?</said>
</P>

<P>
Lydgate did not speak for a few moments.  Then he said, looking at
Dorothea.  <said who="#Lyd">I hardly know.  In my opinion Mrs. Casaubon should do what
would give her the most repose of mind.  That repose will not always
come from being forbidden to act.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Thank you,</said> said Dorothea, exerting herself, <said who="#D">I am sure that is wise.
There are so many things which I ought to attend to.  Why should I sit
here idle?</said>  Then, with an effort to recall subjects not connected with
her agitation, she added, abruptly, <said who="#D">You know every one in Middlemarch,
I think, Mr. Lydgate.  I shall ask you to tell me a great deal.  I have
serious things to do now.  I have a living to give away.  You know Mr.
Tyke and all the—</said> But Dorothea's effort was too much for her; she
broke off and burst into sobs.</P>

<P>Lydgate made her drink a dose of sal volatile.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd"> Let Mrs. Casaubon do as she likes,</said> he said to Sir James, whom he
asked to see before quitting the house.  <said who="#Lyd">She wants perfect freedom, I
think, more than any other prescription.</said>
</P>

<P>
His attendance on Dorothea while her brain was excited, had enabled him
to form some true conclusions concerning the trials of her life.  He
felt sure that she had been suffering from the strain and conflict of
self-repression; and that she was likely now to feel herself only in
another sort of pinfold than that from which she had been released.
</P>

<P>
Lydgate's advice was all the easier for Sir James to follow when he
found that Celia had already told Dorothea the unpleasant fact about
the will. <said who="#JC" direct="false" aloud="false">  There was no help for it now—no reason for any further
delay in the execution of necessary business. </said>  And the next day Sir
James complied at once with her request that he would drive her to
Lowick.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I have no wish to stay there at present,</said> said Dorothea; <said who="#D">I could
hardly bear it.  I am much happier at Freshitt with Celia.  I shall be
able to think better about what should be done at Lowick by looking at
it from a distance.  And I should like to be at the Grange a little
while with my uncle, and go about in all the old walks and among the
people in the village.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#JC">Not yet, I think.  Your uncle is having political company, and you are
better out of the way of such doings,</said> said Sir James, who at that
moment thought of the Grange chiefly as a haunt of young Ladislaw's.
But no word passed between him and Dorothea about the objectionable
part of the will; indeed, both of them felt that the mention of it
between them would be impossible.  Sir James was shy, even with men,
about disagreeable subjects; and the one thing that Dorothea would have
chosen to say, if she had spoken on the matter at all, was forbidden to
her at present because it seemed to be a further exposure of her
husband's injustice.  Yet she did wish that Sir James could know what
had passed between her and her husband about Will Ladislaw's moral
claim on the property: it would then, she thought, be apparent to him
as it was to her, that her husband's strange indelicate proviso had
been chiefly urged by his bitter resistance to that idea of claim, and
not merely by personal feelings more difficult to talk about.  Also, it
must be admitted, Dorothea wished that this could be known for Will's
sake, since her friends seemed to think of him as simply an object of
Mr. Casaubon's charity. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false">  Why should he be compared with an Italian
carrying white mice?  That word quoted from Mrs. Cadwallader seemed
like a mocking travesty wrought in the dark by an impish finger. </said>
</P>

<P>
At Lowick Dorothea searched desk and drawer—searched all her husband's
places of deposit for private writing, but found no paper addressed
especially to her, except that "Synoptical Tabulation", which was
probably only the beginning of many intended directions for her
guidance.  In carrying out this bequest of labor to Dorothea, as in all
else, Mr. Casaubon had been slow and hesitating, oppressed in the plan
of transmitting his work, as he had been in executing it, by the sense
of moving heavily in a dim and clogging medium: distrust of Dorothea's
competence to arrange what he had prepared was subdued only by distrust
of any other redactor. <said who="#C" direct="false" aloud="false">  But he had come at last to create a trust for
himself out of Dorothea's nature: she could do what she resolved to do: </said>
and he willingly imagined her toiling under the fetters of a promise to
erect a tomb with his name upon it.  (Not that Mr. Casaubon called the
future volumes a tomb; he called them the Key to all Mythologies.) But
the months gained on him and left his plans belated: he had only had
time to ask for that promise by which he sought to keep his cold grasp
on Dorothea's life.
</P>

<P>
The grasp had slipped away.  Bound by a pledge given from the depths of
her pity, she would have been capable of undertaking a toil which her
judgment whispered was vain for all uses except that consecration of
faithfulness which is a supreme use.  But now her judgment, instead of
being controlled by duteous devotion, was made active by the
imbittering discovery that in her past union there had lurked the
hidden alienation of secrecy and suspicion. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false">  The living, suffering man
was no longer before her to awaken her pity: there remained only the
retrospect of painful subjection to a husband whose thoughts had been
lower than she had believed, whose exorbitant claims for himself had
even blinded his scrupulous care for his own character, and made him
defeat his own pride by shocking men of ordinary honor.  As for the
property which was the sign of that broken tie, she would have been
glad to be free from it and have nothing more than her original fortune
which had been settled on her, if there had not been duties attached to
ownership, which she ought not to flinch from.  About this property
many troublous questions insisted on rising: had she not been right in
thinking that the half of it ought to go to Will Ladislaw?—but was it
not impossible now for her to do that act of justice?  Mr. Casaubon had
taken a cruelly effective means of hindering her: even with indignation
against him in her heart, any act that seemed a triumphant eluding of
his purpose revolted her. </said>
</P>

<P>
After collecting papers of business which she wished to examine, she
locked up again the desks and drawers—<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> all empty of personal words for
her—empty of any sign that in her husband's lonely brooding his heart
had gone out to her in excuse or explanation;</said>  and she went back to
Freshitt with the sense that around his last hard demand and his last
injurious assertion of his power, the silence was unbroken.
</P>

<P>
Dorothea tried now to turn her thoughts towards immediate duties, and
one of these was of a kind which others were determined to remind her
of.  Lydgate's ear had caught eagerly her mention of the living, and as
soon as he could, he reopened the subject, seeing here a possibility of
making amends for the casting-vote he had once given with an
ill-satisfied conscience.  <said who="#Lyd">Instead of telling you anything about Mr.
Tyke,</said> he said, <said who="#Lyd">I should like to speak of another man—Mr.
Farebrother, the Vicar of St. Botolph's.  His living is a poor one, and
gives him a stinted provision for himself and his family.  His mother,
aunt, and sister all live with him, and depend upon him.  I believe he
has never married because of them.  I never heard such good preaching
as his—such plain, easy eloquence.  He would have done to preach at
St. Paul's Cross after old Latimer.  His talk is just as good about all
subjects: original, simple, clear.  I think him a remarkable fellow: he
ought to have done more than he has done.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Why has he not done more?</said> said Dorothea, interested now in all who
had slipped below their own intention.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">That's a hard question,</said> said Lydgate.  <said who="#Lyd">I find myself that it's
uncommonly difficult to make the right thing work: there are so many
strings pulling at once.  Farebrother often hints that he has got into
the wrong profession; he wants a wider range than that of a poor
clergyman, and I suppose he has no interest to help him on.  He is very
fond of Natural History and various scientific matters, and he is
hampered in reconciling these tastes with his position.  He has no
money to spare—hardly enough to use; and that has led him into
card-playing—Middlemarch is a great place for whist.  He does play for
money, and he wins a good deal.  Of course that takes him into company
a little beneath him, and makes him slack about some things; and yet,
with all that, looking at him as a whole, I think he is one of the most
blameless men I ever knew.  He has neither venom nor doubleness in him,
and those often go with a more correct outside.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I wonder whether he suffers in his conscience because of that habit,</said>
said Dorothea; <said who="#D">I wonder whether he wishes he could leave it off.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I have no doubt he would leave it off, if he were transplanted into
plenty: he would be glad of the time for other things.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">My uncle says that Mr. Tyke is spoken of as an apostolic man,</said> said
Dorothea, meditatively.  She was wishing it were possible to restore
the times of primitive zeal, and yet thinking of Mr. Farebrother with a
strong desire to rescue him from his chance-gotten money.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I don't pretend to say that Farebrother is apostolic,</said> said Lydgate.
<said who="#Lyd">His position is not quite like that of the Apostles: he is only a
parson among parishioners whose lives he has to try and make better.
Practically I find that what is called being apostolic now, is an
impatience of everything in which the parson doesn't cut the principal
figure.  I see something of that in Mr. Tyke at the Hospital: a good
deal of his doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to make people
uncomfortably aware of him.  Besides, an apostolic man at Lowick!—he
ought to think, as St. Francis did, that it is needful to preach to the
birds.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">True,</said> said Dorothea.  <said who="#D">It is hard to imagine what sort of notions our
farmers and laborers get from their teaching.  I have been looking into
a volume of sermons by Mr. Tyke: such sermons would be of no use at
Lowick—I mean, about imputed righteousness and the prophecies in the
Apocalypse.  I have always been thinking of the different ways in which
Christianity is taught, and whenever I find one way that makes it a
wider blessing than any other, I cling to that as the truest—I mean
that which takes in the most good of all kinds, and brings in the most
people as sharers in it.  It is surely better to pardon too much, than
to condemn too much.  But I should like to see Mr. Farebrother and hear
him preach.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Do,</said> said Lydgate; <said who="#Lyd">I trust to the effect of that.  He is very much
beloved, but he has his enemies too: there are always people who can't
forgive an able man for differing from them.  And that money-winning
business is really a blot.  You don't, of course, see many Middlemarch
people: but Mr. Ladislaw, who is constantly seeing Mr. Brooke, is a
great friend of Mr. Farebrother's old ladies, and would be glad to sing
the Vicar's praises.  One of the old ladies—Miss Noble, the aunt—is a
wonderfully quaint picture of self-forgetful goodness, and Ladislaw
gallants her about sometimes.  I met them one day in a back street: you
know Ladislaw's look—a sort of Daphnis in coat and waistcoat; and this
little old maid reaching up to his arm—they looked like a couple
dropped out of a romantic comedy.  But the best evidence about
Farebrother is to see him and hear him.</said>
</P>

<P>
Happily Dorothea was in her private sitting-room when this conversation
occurred, and there was no one present to make Lydgate's innocent
introduction of Ladislaw painful to her.  As was usual with him in
matters of personal gossip, Lydgate had quite forgotten Rosamond's
remark that she thought Will adored Mrs. Casaubon.  At that moment he
was only caring for what would recommend the Farebrother family; and he
had purposely given emphasis to the worst that could be said about the
Vicar, in order to forestall objections.  In the weeks since Mr.
Casaubon's death he had hardly seen Ladislaw, and he had heard no rumor
to warn him that Mr. Brooke's confidential secretary was a dangerous
subject with Mrs. Casaubon.  When he was gone, his picture of Ladislaw
lingered in her mind and disputed the ground with that question of the
Lowick living. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false">  What was Will Ladislaw thinking about her?  Would he
hear of that fact which made her cheeks burn as they never used to do?
And how would he feel when he heard it?—But she could see as well as
possible how he smiled down at the little old maid.  An Italian with
white mice!—on the contrary, he was a creature who entered into every
one's feelings, and could take the pressure of their thought instead of
urging his own with iron resistance.</said>

<BR/>

<P>
No gossip about Mr. Casaubon's will had yet reached Ladislaw: the air
seemed to be filled with the dissolution of Parliament and the coming
election, as the old wakes and fairs were filled with the rival clatter
of itinerant shows; and more private noises were taken little notice
of.  The famous "dry election" was at hand, in which the depths of
public feeling might be measured by the low flood-mark of drink.  Will
Ladislaw was one of the busiest at this time; and though Dorothea's
widowhood was continually in his thought, he was so far from wishing to
be spoken to on the subject, that when Lydgate sought him out to tell
him what had passed about the Lowick living, he answered rather
waspishly—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Why should you bring me into the matter?  I never see Mrs. Casaubon,
and am not likely to see her, since she is at Freshitt.  I never go
there.  It is Tory ground, where I and the 'Pioneer' are no more
welcome than a poacher and his gun.</said>
</P>

<P>
The fact was that Will had been made the more susceptible by observing
that Mr. Brooke, instead of wishing him, as before, to come to the
Grange oftener than was quite agreeable to himself, seemed now to
contrive that he should go there as little as possible.  This was a
shuffling concession of Mr. Brooke's to Sir James Chettam's indignant
remonstrance; and Will, awake to the slightest hint in this direction,
concluded that he was to be kept away from the Grange on Dorothea's
account. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false">  Her friends, then, regarded him with some suspicion?  Their
fears were quite superfluous: they were very much mistaken if they
imagined that he would put himself forward as a needy adventurer trying
to win the favor of a rich woman. </said>
</P>

<P>
Until now Will had never fully seen the chasm between himself and
Dorothea—until now that he was come to the brink of it, and saw her on
the other side.  He began, not without some inward rage, to think of
going away from the neighborhood:<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false">  it would be impossible for him to
show any further interest in Dorothea without subjecting himself to
disagreeable imputations—perhaps even in her mind, which others might
try to poison. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">We are forever divided,</said> said Will.  <said who="#Lad">I might as well be at Rome; she
would be no farther from me.</said> <first> But what we call our despair is often
only the painful eagerness of unfed hope. </first> <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> There were plenty of reasons
why he should not go—public reasons why he should not quit his post at
this crisis, leaving Mr. Brooke in the lurch when he needed "coaching"
for the election, and when there was so much canvassing, direct and
indirect, to be carried on.  Will could not like to leave his own
chessmen in the heat of a game; and any candidate on the right side,
even if his brain and marrow had been as soft as was consistent with a
gentlemanly bearing, might help to turn a majority.  To coach Mr.
Brooke and keep him steadily to the idea that he must pledge himself to
vote for the actual Reform Bill, instead of insisting on his
independence and power of pulling up in time, was not an easy task.
Mr. Farebrother's prophecy of a fourth candidate "in the bag" had not
yet been fulfilled, neither the Parliamentary Candidate Society nor any
other power on the watch to secure a reforming majority seeing a worthy
nodus for interference while there was a second reforming candidate
like Mr. Brooke, who might be returned at his own expense; and the
fight lay entirely between Pinkerton the old Tory member, Bagster the
new Whig member returned at the last election, and Brooke the future
independent member, who was to fetter himself for this occasion only.
Mr. Hawley and his party would bend all their forces to the return of
Pinkerton, and Mr. Brooke's success must depend either on plumpers
which would leave Bagster in the rear, or on the new minting of Tory
votes into reforming votes.  The latter means, of course, would be
preferable.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> This prospect of converting votes was a dangerous distraction to Mr.
Brooke: his impression that waverers were likely to be allured by
wavering statements, and also the liability of his mind to stick afresh
at opposing arguments as they turned up in his memory, gave Will
Ladislaw much trouble. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">You know there are tactics in these things,</said> said Mr. Brooke; <said who="#MB">meeting
people half-way—tempering your ideas—saying, 'Well now, there's
something in that,' and so on.  I agree with you that this is a
peculiar occasion—the country with a will of its own—political
unions—that sort of thing—but we sometimes cut with rather too sharp
a knife, Ladislaw.  These ten-pound householders, now: why ten?  Draw
the line somewhere—yes: but why just at ten?  That's a difficult
question, now, if you go into it.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Of course it is,</said> said Will, impatiently.  <said who="#Lad">But if you are to wait
till we get a logical Bill, you must put yourself forward as a
revolutionist, and then Middlemarch would not elect you, I fancy.  As
for trimming, this is not a time for trimming.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Brooke always ended by agreeing with Ladislaw, <said who="#MB" direct="false" aloud="false"> who still appeared
to him a sort of Burke with a leaven of Shelley; </said> but after an interval
the wisdom of his own methods reasserted itself, and he was again drawn
into using them with much hopefulness.  At this stage of affairs he was
in excellent spirits, which even supported him under large advances of
money; for his powers of convincing and persuading had not yet been
tested by anything more difficult than a chairman's speech introducing
other orators, or a dialogue with a Middlemarch voter, from which he
came away with a sense that he was a tactician by nature, and that it
was a pity he had not gone earlier into this kind of thing.  He was a
little conscious of defeat, however, with Mr. Mawmsey, a chief
representative in Middlemarch of that great social power, the retail
trader, and naturally one of the most doubtful voters in the
borough—willing for his own part to supply an equal quality of teas
and sugars to reformer and anti-reformer, as well as to agree
impartially with both, and feeling like the burgesses of old that this
necessity of electing members was a great burthen to a town; <said who="#Mawmsey" direct="false" aloud="false"> for even
if there were no danger in holding out hopes to all parties beforehand,
there would be the painful necessity at last of disappointing
respectable people whose names were on his books. He was accustomed to
receive large orders from Mr. Brooke of Tipton; but then, there were
many of Pinkerton's committee whose opinions had a great weight of
grocery on their side. </FID  Mr. Mawmsey thinking that Mr. Brooke, as not
too <said who="#Mawmsey">clever in his intellects,</said> was the more likely to forgive a grocer
who gave a hostile vote under pressure, had become confidential in his
back parlor.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Mawmsey">As to Reform, sir, put it in a family light,</said> he said, rattling the
small silver in his pocket, and smiling affably.  <said who="#Mawmsey">Will it support Mrs.
Mawmsey, and enable her to bring up six children when I am no more?  I
put the question <emph rend="italics">fictiously</emph>, knowing what must be the answer.  Very
well, sir.  I ask you what, as a husband and a father, I am to do when
gentlemen come to me and say, 'Do as you like, Mawmsey; but if you vote
against us, I shall get my groceries elsewhere: when I sugar my liquor
I like to feel that I am benefiting the country by maintaining
tradesmen of the right color.'  Those very words have been spoken to
me, sir, in the very chair where you are now sitting.  I don't mean by
your honorable self, Mr. Brooke.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">No, no, no—that's narrow, you know.  Until my butler complains to me
of your goods, Mr. Mawmsey,</said> said Mr. Brooke, soothingly, <said who="#MB">until I hear
that you send bad sugars, spices—that sort of thing—I shall never
order him to go elsewhere.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Mawmsey">Sir, I am your humble servant, and greatly obliged,</said> said Mr. Mawmsey,
feeling that politics were clearing up a little.  <said who="#Mawmsey">There would be some
pleasure in voting for a gentleman who speaks in that honorable manner.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Well, you know, Mr. Mawmsey, you would find it the right thing to put
yourself on our side.  This Reform will touch everybody by-and-by—a
thoroughly popular measure—a sort of A, B, C, you know, that must come
first before the rest can follow.  I quite agree with you that you've
got to look at the thing in a family light: but public spirit, now.
We're all one family, you know—it's all one cupboard.  Such a thing
as a vote, now: why, it may help to make men's fortunes at the
Cape—there's no knowing what may be the effect of a vote,</said> Mr. Brooke
ended, with a sense of being a little out at sea, though finding it
still enjoyable.  But Mr. Mawmsey answered in a tone of decisive check.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Mawmsey">I beg your pardon, sir, but I can't afford that.  When I give a vote I
must know what I am doing; I must look to what will be the effects on
my till and ledger, speaking respectfully.  Prices, I'll admit, are
what nobody can know the merits of; and the sudden falls after you've
bought in currants, which are a goods that will not keep—I've never;
myself seen into the ins and outs there; which is a rebuke to human
pride.  But as to one family, there's debtor and creditor, I hope;
they're not going to reform that away; else I should vote for things
staying as they are.  Few men have less need to cry for change than I
have, personally speaking—that is, for self and family.  I am not one
of those who have nothing to lose: I mean as to respectability both in
parish and private business, and noways in respect of your honorable
self and custom, which you was good enough to say you would not
withdraw from me, vote or no vote, while the article sent in was
satisfactory.</said>
</P>

<P>
After this conversation Mr. Mawmsey went up and boasted to his wife
that he had been rather too many for Brooke of Tipton, and that he
didn't mind so much now about going to the poll.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Brooke on this occasion abstained from boasting of his tactics to
Ladislaw, who for his part was glad enough to persuade himself that he
had no concern with any canvassing except the purely argumentative
sort, and that he worked no meaner engine than knowledge.  Mr. Brooke,
necessarily, had his agents, who understood the nature of the
Middlemarch voter and the means of enlisting his ignorance on the side
of the Bill—which were remarkably similar to the means of enlisting it
on the side against the Bill.  Will stopped his ears. <first> Occasionally
Parliament, like the rest of our lives, even to our eating and apparel,
could hardly go on if our imaginations were too active about processes. </first>
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> There were plenty of dirty-handed men in the world to do dirty
business;</said>  and Will protested to himself that his share in bringing Mr.
Brooke through would be quite innocent.
</P>

<P>
But whether he should succeed in that mode of contributing to the
majority on the right side was very doubtful to him.  He had written
out various speeches and memoranda for speeches, but he had begun to
perceive that Mr. Brooke's mind, if it had the burthen of remembering
any train of thought, would let it drop, run away in search of it, and
not easily come back again. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> <second> To collect documents is one mode of
serving your country, and to remember the contents of a document is
another. </second> No! the only way in which Mr. Brooke could be coerced into
thinking of the right arguments at the right time was to be well plied
with them till they took up all the room in his brain. </said> <said who="#MB" direct="false" aloud="false">  But here there
was the difficulty of finding room, so many things having been taken in
beforehand.</said>  Mr. Brooke himself observed that his ideas stood rather in
his way when he was speaking.
</P>

<P>
However, Ladislaw's coaching was forthwith to be put to the test, for
before the day of nomination Mr. Brooke was to explain himself to the
worthy electors of Middlemarch from the balcony of the White Hart,
which looked out advantageously at an angle of the market-place,
commanding a large area in front and two converging streets.  It was a
fine May morning, and everything seemed hopeful: there was some
prospect of an understanding between Bagster's committee and Brooke's,
to which Mr. Bulstrode, Mr. Standish as a Liberal lawyer, and such
manufacturers as Mr. Plymdale and Mr. Vincy, gave a solidity which
almost counterbalanced Mr. Hawley and his associates who sat for
Pinkerton at the Green Dragon.  Mr. Brooke, conscious of having
weakened the blasts of the "Trumpet" against him, by his reforms as a
landlord in the last half year, and hearing himself cheered a little as
he drove into the town, felt his heart tolerably light under his
buff-colored waistcoat.  But with regard to critical occasions, it
often happens that all moments seem comfortably remote until the last.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">This looks well, eh?</said> said Mr. Brooke as the crowd gathered.  <said who="#MB">I shall
have a good audience, at any rate.  I like this, now—this kind of
public made up of one's own neighbors, you know.</said>
</P>

<P>
The weavers and tanners of Middlemarch, unlike Mr. Mawmsey, had never
thought of Mr. Brooke as a neighbor, and were not more attached to him
than if he had been sent in a box from London.  But they listened
without much disturbance to the speakers who introduced the candidate,
one of them—a political personage from Brassing, who came to tell
Middlemarch its duty—spoke so fully, that it was alarming to think
what the candidate could find to say after him.  Meanwhile the crowd
became denser, and as the political personage neared the end of his
speech, Mr. Brooke felt a remarkable change in his sensations while he
still handled his eye-glass, trifled with documents before him, and
exchanged remarks with his committee, as a man to whom the moment of
summons was indifferent.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">I'll take another glass of sherry, Ladislaw,</said> he said, with an easy
air, to Will, who was close behind him, and presently handed him the
supposed fortifier.  It was ill-chosen; for Mr. Brooke was an
abstemious man, and to drink a second glass of sherry quickly at no
great interval from the first was a surprise to his system which tended
to scatter his energies instead of collecting them.  Pray pity him: so
many English gentlemen make themselves miserable by speechifying on
entirely private grounds!  whereas Mr. Brooke wished to serve his
country by standing for Parliament—which, indeed, may also be done on
private grounds, but being once undertaken does absolutely demand some
speechifying.
</P>

<P>
It was not about the beginning of his speech that Mr. Brooke was at all
anxious; this, he felt sure, would be all right;<said who="#MB" direct="false" aloud="false">  he should have it
quite pat, cut out as neatly as a set of couplets from Pope.  Embarking
would be easy, but the vision of open sea that might come after was
alarming. </said>  <said who="#MB">And questions, now,</said> hinted the demon just waking up in his
stomach, <said who="#MB">somebody may put questions about the schedules.—Ladislaw,</said>
he continued, aloud, <said who="#MB">just hand me the memorandum of the schedules.</said>
</P>

<P>
When Mr. Brooke presented himself on the balcony, the cheers were quite
loud enough to counterbalance the yells, groans, brayings, and other
expressions of adverse theory, which were so moderate that Mr. Standish
(decidedly an old bird) observed in the ear next to him, <said who="#Standish">This looks
dangerous, by God!  Hawley has got some deeper plan than this.</said>  Still,
the cheers were exhilarating, and no candidate could look more amiable
than Mr. Brooke, with the memorandum in his breast-pocket, his left
hand on the rail of the balcony, and his right trifling with his
eye-glass. The striking points in his appearance were his buff
waistcoat, short-clipped blond hair, and neutral physiognomy.  He began
with some confidence.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Gentlemen—Electors of Middlemarch!</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB" direct="false" aloud="false"> This was so much the right thing that a little pause after it seemed
natural. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">I'm uncommonly glad to be here—I was never so proud and happy in my
life—never so happy, you know.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB" direct="false" aloud="false"> This was a bold figure of speech, but not exactly the right thing; for,
unhappily, the pat opening had slipped away </said>—<first> even couplets from Pope
may be but "fallings from us, vanishings", when fear clutches us, and a
glass of sherry is hurrying like smoke among our ideas. </first> Ladislaw, who
stood at the window behind the speaker, thought, <said who="#Lad">it's all up now.  The
only chance is that, since the best thing won't always do, floundering
may answer for once.</said> <said who="#MB" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mr. Brooke, meanwhile, having lost other clews,
fell back on himself and his qualifications—always an appropriate
graceful subject for a candidate. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">I am a close neighbor of yours, my good friends—you've known me on
the bench a good while—I've always gone a good deal into public
questions—machinery, now, and machine-breaking—you're many of you
concerned with machinery, and I've been going into that lately.  It
won't do, you know, breaking machines: everything must go on—trade,
manufactures, commerce, interchange of staples—that kind of
thing—since Adam Smith, that must go on.  We must look all over the
globe:—'Observation with extensive view,' must look everywhere, 'from
China to Peru,' as somebody says—Johnson, I think, 'The Rambler,' you
know.  That is what I have done up to a certain point—not as far as
Peru; but I've not always stayed at home—I saw it wouldn't do.  I've
been in the Levant, where some of your Middlemarch goods go—and then,
again, in the Baltic.  The Baltic, now.</said>
</P>

<P>
Plying among his recollections in this way, Mr. Brooke might have got
along, easily to himself, and would have come back from the remotest
seas without trouble; but a diabolical procedure had been set up by the
enemy.  At one and the same moment there had risen above the shoulders
of the crowd, nearly opposite Mr. Brooke, and within ten yards of him,
the effigy of himself: buff-colored waistcoat, eye-glass, and neutral
physiognomy, painted on rag; and there had arisen, apparently in the
air, like the note of the cuckoo, a parrot-like, Punch-voiced echo of
his words.  Everybody looked up at the open windows in the houses at
the opposite angles of the converging streets; but they were either
blank, or filled by laughing listeners.  The most innocent echo has an
impish mockery in it when it follows a gravely persistent speaker, and
this echo was not at all innocent; if it did not follow with the
precision of a natural echo, it had a wicked choice of the words it
overtook.  By the time it said, "The Baltic, now", the laugh which had
been running through the audience became a general shout, and but for
the sobering effects of party and that great public cause which the
entanglement of things had identified with "Brooke of Tipton" the
laugh might have caught his committee.  Mr. Bulstrode asked,
reprehensively, what the new police was doing; but a voice could not
well be collared, and an attack on the effigy of the candidate would
have been too equivocal, since Hawley probably meant it to be pelted.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Brooke himself was not in a position to be quickly conscious of
anything except a general slipping away of ideas within himself: he had
even a little singing in the ears, and he was the only person who had
not yet taken distinct account of the echo or discerned the image of
himself. <first> Few things hold the perceptions more thoroughly captive than
anxiety about what we have got to say. </first> Mr. Brooke heard the laughter;
but he had expected some Tory efforts at disturbance, and he was at
this moment additionally excited by the tickling, stinging sense that
his lost exordium was coming back to fetch him from the Baltic.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">That reminds me,</said> he went on, thrusting a hand into his side-pocket,
with an easy air, <said who="#MB">if I wanted a precedent, you know—but we never want
a precedent for the right thing—but there is Chatham, now; I can't say
I should have supported Chatham, or Pitt, the younger Pitt—he was not
a man of ideas, and we want ideas, you know.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#unnamed">Blast your ideas! we want the Bill,</said> said a loud rough voice from the
crowd below.
</P>

<P>
Immediately the invisible Punch, who had hitherto followed Mr. Brooke,
repeated, <said who="#unnamed">Blast your ideas! we want the Bill.</said> The laugh was louder
than ever, and for the first time Mr. Brooke being himself silent,
heard distinctly the mocking echo. <said who="#MB" direct="false" aloud="false"> But it seemed to ridicule his
interrupter, and in that light was encouraging; </said>so he replied with
amenity—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">There is something in what you say, my good friend, and what do we
meet for but to speak our minds—freedom of opinion, freedom of the
press, liberty—that kind of thing?  The Bill, now—you shall have the
Bill</said>—here Mr. Brooke paused a moment to fix on his eye-glass and take
the paper from his breast-pocket, with a sense of being practical and
coming to particulars.  The invisible Punch followed:—
</P>

<P>
<said> You shall have the Bill, Mr. Brooke, per electioneering contest, and a
seat outside Parliament as delivered, five thousand pounds, seven
shillings, and fourpence.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Brooke, amid the roars of laughter, turned red, let his eye-glass
fall, and looking about him confusedly, saw the image of himself, which
had come nearer.  The next moment he saw it dolorously bespattered with
eggs.  His spirit rose a little, and his voice too.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">Buffoonery, tricks, ridicule the test of truth—all that is very
well</said>—here an unpleasant egg broke on Mr. Brooke's shoulder, as the
echo said, <said>All that is very well;</said> then came a hail of eggs, chiefly
aimed at the image, but occasionally hitting the original, as if by
chance.  There was a stream of new men pushing among the crowd;
whistles, yells, bellowings, and fifes made all the greater hubbub
because there was shouting and struggling to put them down.  No voice
would have had wing enough to rise above the uproar, and Mr. Brooke,
disagreeably anointed, stood his ground no longer. <said who="#MB" direct="false" aloud="false"> The frustration
would have been less exasperating if it had been less gamesome and
boyish: a serious assault of which the newspaper reporter "can aver
that it endangered the learned gentleman's ribs", or can respectfully
bear witness to "the soles of that gentleman's boots having been
visible above the railing", has perhaps more consolations attached to
it.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Brooke re-entered the committee-room, saying, as carelessly as he
could, <said who="#MB">This is a little too bad, you know.  I should have got the ear
of the people by-and-by—but they didn't give me time.  I should have
gone into the Bill by-and-by, you know,</said> he added, glancing at
Ladislaw.  <said who="#MB">However, things will come all right at the nomination.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB" direct="false" aloud="false"> But it was not resolved unanimously that things would come right; on
the contrary, the committee looked rather grim, and the political
personage from Brassing was writing busily, as if he were brewing new
devices. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Standish">It was Bowyer who did it,</said> said Mr. Standish, evasively.  <said who="#Standish">I know it
as well as if he had been advertised.  He's uncommonly good at
ventriloquism, and he did it uncommonly well, by God!  Hawley has been
having him to dinner lately: there's a fund of talent in Bowyer.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB"> Well, you know, you never mentioned him to me, Standish, else I would
have invited him to dine,</said> said poor Mr. Brooke, who had gone through a
great deal of inviting for the good of his country.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">There's not a more paltry fellow in Middlemarch than Bowyer,</said> said
Ladislaw, indignantly, <said who="#Lad">but it seems as if the paltry fellows were
always to turn the scale.</said>
</P>

<P>
Will was thoroughly out of temper with himself as well as with his
"principal", and he went to shut himself in his rooms with a
half-formed resolve to throw up the "Pioneer" and Mr. Brooke together.
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> Why should he stay?  If the impassable gulf between himself and
Dorothea were ever to be filled up, it must rather be by his going away
and getting into a thoroughly different position than by staying here
and slipping into deserved contempt as an understrapper of Brooke's.
Then came the young dream of wonders that he might do—in five years,
for example: political writing, political speaking, would get a higher
value now public life was going to be wider and more national, and they
might give him such distinction that he would not seem to be asking
Dorothea to step down to him.  Five years:—if he could only be sure
that she cared for him more than for others; if he could only make her
aware that he stood aloof until he could tell his love without lowering
himself—then he could go away easily, and begin a career which at
five-and-twenty seemed probable enough in the inward order of things,
where talent brings fame, and fame everything else which is delightful.
He could speak and he could write; he could master any subject if he
chose, and he meant always to take the side of reason and justice, on
which he would carry all his ardor.  Why should he not one day be
lifted above the shoulders of the crowd, and feel that he had won that
eminence well?  Without doubt he would leave Middlemarch, go to town,
and make himself fit for celebrity by "eating his dinners".
</P> </said>

<P>
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false">But not immediately: not until some kind of sign had passed between him
and Dorothea.  He could not be satisfied until she knew why, even if he
were the man she would choose to marry, he would not marry her.  Hence
he must keep his post and bear with Mr. Brooke a little longer. </said>
</P>

<P>
But he soon had reason to suspect that Mr. Brooke had anticipated him
in the wish to break up their connection.  Deputations without and
voices within had concurred in inducing that philanthropist to take a
stronger measure than usual for the good of mankind; namely, to
withdraw in favor of another candidate, to whom he left the advantages
of his canvassing machinery.  He himself called this a strong measure,
but observed that his health was less capable of sustaining excitement
than he had imagined.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">I have felt uneasy about the chest—it won't do to carry that too
far,</said> he said to Ladislaw in explaining the affair.  <said who="#MB">I must pull up.
Poor Casaubon was a warning, you know.  I've made some heavy advances,
but I've dug a channel.  It's rather coarse work—this electioneering,
eh, Ladislaw? dare say you are tired of it.  However, we have dug a
channel with the 'Pioneer'—put things in a track, and so on.  A more
ordinary man than you might carry it on now—more ordinary, you know.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Do you wish me to give it up?</said> said Will, the quick color coming in
his face, as he rose from the writing-table, and took a turn of three
steps with his hands in his pockets.  <said who="#Lad">I am ready to do so whenever you
wish it.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">As to wishing, my dear Ladislaw, I have the highest opinion of your
powers, you know.  But about the 'Pioneer,' I have been consulting a
little with some of the men on our side, and they are inclined to take
it into their hands—indemnify me to a certain extent—carry it on, in
fact.  And under the circumstances, you might like to give up—might
find a better field.  These people might not take that high view of you
which I have always taken, as an alter ego, a right hand—though I
always looked forward to your doing something else.  I think of having
a run into France.  But I'll write you any letters, you know—to
Althorpe and people of that kind.  I've met Althorpe.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I am exceedingly obliged to you,</said> said Ladislaw, proudly.  <said who="#Lad">Since you
are going to part with the 'Pioneer,' I need not trouble you about the
steps I shall take.  I may choose to continue here for the present.</said>
</P>

<P>
After Mr. Brooke had left him Will said to himself, <said who="#MB">The rest of the
family have been urging him to get rid of me, and he doesn't care now
about my going.  I shall stay as long as I like.  I shall go of my own
movements and not because they are afraid of me.</said>

On that June evening when Mr. Farebrother knew that he was to have the
Lowick living, there was joy in the old fashioned parlor, and even the
portraits of the great lawyers seemed to look on with satisfaction.
His mother left her tea and toast untouched, but sat with her usual
pretty primness, only showing her emotion by that flush in the cheeks
and brightness in the eyes which give an old woman a touching momentary
identity with her far-off youthful self, and saying decisively—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MFB">The greatest comfort, Camden, is that you have deserved it.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">When a man gets a good berth, mother, half the deserving must come
after,</said> said the son, brimful of pleasure, and not trying to conceal
it.  The gladness in his face was of that active kind which seems to
have energy enough not only to flash outwardly, but to light up busy
vision within: one seemed to see thoughts, as well as delight, in his
glances.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Now, aunt,</said> he went on, rubbing his hands and looking at Miss Noble,
who was making tender little beaver-like noises, <said who="#FB">There shall be
sugar-candy always on the table for you to steal and give to the
children, and you shall have a great many new stockings to make
presents of, and you shall darn your own more than ever!</said>
</P>

<P>
Miss Noble nodded at her nephew with a subdued half-frightened laugh,
conscious of having already dropped an additional lump of sugar into
her basket on the strength of the new preferment.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">As for you, Winny</said>—the Vicar went on—<said who="#FB">I shall make no difficulty
about your marrying any Lowick bachelor—Mr. Solomon Featherstone, for
example, as soon as I find you are in love with him.</said>
</P>

<P>
Miss Winifred, who had been looking at her brother all the while and
crying heartily, which was her way of rejoicing, smiled through her
tears and said, <said who="#Winifred">You must set me the example, Cam: <emph rend="italics">you</emph> must marry
now.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">With all my heart.  But who is in love with me?  I am a seedy old
fellow,</said> said the Vicar, rising, pushing his chair away and looking
down at himself.  <said who="#FB">What do you say, mother?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MFB">You are a handsome man, Camden: though not so fine a figure of a man
as your father,</said> said the old lady.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Winifred">I wish you would marry Miss Garth, brother,</said> said Miss Winifred.  <said who="#Winifred">She
would make us so lively at Lowick.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Very fine! You talk as if young women were tied up to be chosen, like
poultry at market; as if I had only to ask and everybody would have
me,</said> said the Vicar, not caring to specify.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Winifred">We don't want everybody,</said> said Miss Winifred.  <said who="#Winifred">But <emph rend="italics">you</emph> would like
Miss Garth, mother, shouldn't you?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MFB">My son's choice shall be mine,</said> said Mrs. Farebrother, with majestic
discretion, <said who="#MFB">and a wife would be most welcome, Camden.  You will want
your whist at home when we go to Lowick, and Henrietta Noble never was
a whist-player.</said> (Mrs. Farebrother always called her tiny old sister by
that magnificent name.)
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">I shall do without whist now, mother.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MFB">Why so, Camden?  In my time whist was thought an undeniable amusement
for a good churchman,</said> said Mrs. Farebrother, innocent of the meaning
that whist had for her son, and speaking rather sharply, as at some
dangerous countenancing of new doctrine.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">I shall be too busy for whist; I shall have two parishes,</said> said the
Vicar, preferring not to discuss the virtues of that game.
</P>

<P>
He had already said to Dorothea, <said who="#FB">I don't feel bound to give up St.
Botolph's. It is protest enough against the pluralism they want to
reform if I give somebody else most of the money.  The stronger thing
is not to give up power, but to use it well.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I have thought of that,</said> said Dorothea.  <said who="#D">So far as self is concerned,
I think it would be easier to give up power and money than to keep
them.  It seems very unfitting that I should have this patronage, yet I
felt that I ought not to let it be used by some one else instead of me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">It is I who am bound to act so that you will not regret your power,</said>
said Mr. Farebrother.
</P>

<P>
His was one of the natures in which conscience gets the more active
when the yoke of life ceases to gall them.  He made no display of
humility on the subject, but in his heart he felt rather ashamed that
his conduct had shown laches which others who did not get benefices
were free from.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">I used often to wish I had been something else than a clergyman,</said> he
said to Lydgate, <said who="#FB">but perhaps it will be better to try and make as good
a clergyman out of myself as I can.  That is the well-beneficed point
of view, you perceive, from which difficulties are much simplified,</said> he
ended, smiling.
</P>

<P>
The Vicar did feel then as if his share of duties would be easy. <first> But
Duty has a trick of behaving unexpectedly—something like a heavy
friend whom we have amiably asked to visit us, and who breaks his leg
within our gates. </first>
</P>

<P>
Hardly a week later, Duty presented itself in his study under the
disguise of Fred Vincy, now returned from Omnibus College with his
bachelor's degree.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">I am ashamed to trouble you, Mr. Farebrother,</said> said Fred, whose fair
open face was propitiating, <said who="#F">but you are the only friend I can consult.
I told you everything once before, and you were so good that I can't
help coming to you again.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Sit down, Fred, I'm ready to hear and do anything I can,</said> said the
Vicar, who was busy packing some small objects for removal, and went on
with his work.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">I wanted to tell you—</said> Fred hesitated an instant and then went on
plungingly, <said who="#F">I might go into the Church now; and really, look where I
may, I can't see anything else to do.  I don't like it, but I know it's
uncommonly hard on my father to say so, after he has spent a good deal
of money in educating me for it.</said> Fred paused again an instant, and
then repeated, <said who="#F">and I can't see anything else to do.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">I did talk to your father about it, Fred, but I made little way with
him.  He said it was too late.  But you have got over one bridge now:
what are your other difficulties?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Merely that I don't like it.  I don't like divinity, and preaching,
and feeling obliged to look serious.  I like riding across country, and
doing as other men do.  I don't mean that I want to be a bad fellow in
any way; but I've no taste for the sort of thing people expect of a
clergyman.  And yet what else am I to do?  My father can't spare me any
capital, else I might go into farming.  And he has no room for me in
his trade.  And of course I can't begin to study for law or physic now,
when my father wants me to earn something.  It's all very well to say
I'm wrong to go into the Church; but those who say so might as well
tell me to go into the backwoods.</said>
</P>

<P>
Fred's voice had taken a tone of grumbling remonstrance, and Mr.
Farebrother might have been inclined to smile if his mind had not been
too busy in imagining more than Fred told him.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Have you any difficulties about doctrines—about the Articles?</said> he
said, trying hard to think of the question simply for Fred's sake.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">No; I suppose the Articles are right.  I am not prepared with any
arguments to disprove them, and much better, cleverer fellows than I am
go in for them entirely.  I think it would be rather ridiculous in me
to urge scruples of that sort, as if I were a judge,</said> said Fred, quite
simply.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">I suppose, then, it has occurred to you that you might be a fair
parish priest without being much of a divine?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Of course, if I am obliged to be a clergyman, I shall try and do my
duty, though I mayn't like it.  Do you think any body ought to blame
me?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">For going into the Church under the circumstances?  That depends on
your conscience, Fred—how far you have counted the cost, and seen what
your position will require of you.  I can only tell you about myself,
that I have always been too lax, and have been uneasy in consequence.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">But there is another hindrance,</said> said Fred, coloring.  <said who="#F">I did not tell
you before, though perhaps I may have said things that made you guess
it.  There is somebody I am very fond of: I have loved her ever since
we were children.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Miss Garth, I suppose?</said> said the Vicar, examining some labels very
closely.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Yes.  I shouldn't mind anything if she would have me.  And I know I
could be a good fellow then.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">And you think she returns the feeling?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">She never will say so; and a good while ago she made me promise not to
speak to her about it again.  And she has set her mind especially
against my being a clergyman; I know that.  But I can't give her up.  I
do think she cares about me.  I saw Mrs. Garth last night, and she said
that Mary was staying at Lowick Rectory with Miss Farebrother.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Yes, she is very kindly helping my sister.  Do you wish to go there?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">No, I want to ask a great favor of you.  I am ashamed to bother you in
this way; but Mary might listen to what you said, if you mentioned the
subject to her—I mean about my going into the Church.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB"> That is rather a delicate task, my dear Fred.  I shall have to
presuppose your attachment to her; and to enter on the subject as you
wish me to do, will be asking her to tell me whether she returns it.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">That is what I want her to tell you,</said> said Fred, bluntly.  <said who="#F">I don't
know what to do, unless I can get at her feeling.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">You mean that you would be guided by that as to your going into the
Church?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">If Mary said she would never have me I might as well go wrong in one
way as another.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">That is nonsense, Fred.  Men outlive their love, but they don't
outlive the consequences of their recklessness.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Not my sort of love: I have never been without loving Mary.  If I had
to give her up, it would be like beginning to live on wooden legs.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Will she not be hurt at my intrusion?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">No, I feel sure she will not.  She respects you more than any one, and
she would not put you off with fun as she does me.  Of course I could
not have told any one else, or asked any one else to speak to her, but
you.  There is no one else who could be such a friend to both of us.</said>
Fred paused a moment, and then said, rather complainingly, <said who="#F">And she
ought to acknowledge that I have worked in order to pass.  She ought to
believe that I would exert myself for her sake.</said>
</P>

<P>
There was a moment's silence before Mr. Farebrother laid down his work,
and putting out his hand to Fred said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Very well, my boy.  I will do what you wish.</said>
</P>

<P>
That very day Mr. Farebrother went to Lowick parsonage on the nag which
he had just set up.  <said who="#FB">Decidedly I am an old stalk,</said> he thought, <said who="#FB">the
young growths are pushing me aside.</said>
</P>

<P>
He found Mary in the garden gathering roses and sprinkling the petals
on a sheet.  The sun was low, and tall trees sent their shadows across
the grassy walks where Mary was moving without bonnet or parasol.  She
did not observe Mr. Farebrother's approach along the grass, and had
just stooped down to lecture a small black-and-tan terrier, which would
persist in walking on the sheet and smelling at the rose-leaves as Mary
sprinkled them.  She took his fore-paws in one hand, and lifted up the
forefinger of the other, while the dog wrinkled his brows and looked
embarrassed.  <said who="#M">Fly, Fly, I am ashamed of you,</said> Mary was saying in a
grave contralto.  <said who="#M">This is not becoming in a sensible dog; anybody
would think you were a silly young gentleman.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">You are unmerciful to young gentlemen, Miss Garth,</said> said the Vicar,
within two yards of her.
</P>

<P>
Mary started up and blushed.  <said who="#M">It always answers to reason with Fly,</said>
she said, laughingly.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">But not with young gentlemen?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Oh, with some, I suppose; since some of them turn into excellent men.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">I am glad of that admission, because I want at this very moment to
interest you in a young gentleman.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Not a silly one, I hope,</said> said Mary, beginning to pluck the roses
again, and feeling her heart beat uncomfortably.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">No; though perhaps wisdom is not his strong point, but rather
affection and sincerity.  However, wisdom lies more in those two
qualities than people are apt to imagine.  I hope you know by those
marks what young gentleman I mean.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Yes, I think I do,</said> said Mary, bravely, her face getting more serious,
and her hands cold; <said>it must be Fred Vincy.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">He has asked me to consult you about his going into the Church.  I
hope you will not think that I consented to take a liberty in promising
to do so.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">On the contrary, Mr. Farebrother,</said> said Mary, giving up the roses, and
folding her arms, but unable to look up, <said who="#M">whenever you have anything to
say to me I feel honored.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">But before I enter on that question, let me just touch a point on
which your father took me into confidence; by the way, it was that very
evening on which I once before fulfilled a mission from Fred, just
after he had gone to college.  Mr. Garth told me what happened on the
night of Featherstone's death—how you refused to burn the will; and he
said that you had some heart-prickings on that subject, because you had
been the innocent means of hindering Fred from getting his ten thousand
pounds.  I have kept that in mind, and I have heard something that may
relieve you on that score—may show you that no sin-offering is
demanded from you there.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Farebrother paused a moment and looked at Mary.  He meant to give
Fred his full advantage, but it would be well, he thought, to clear her
mind of any superstitions, such as women sometimes follow when they do
a man the wrong of marrying him as an act of atonement.  Mary's cheeks
had begun to burn a little, and she was mute.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">I mean, that your action made no real difference to Fred's lot.  I
find that the first will would not have been legally good after the
burning of the last; it would not have stood if it had been disputed,
and you may be sure it would have been disputed.  So, on that score,
you may feel your mind free.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Thank you, Mr. Farebrother,</said> said Mary, earnestly.  <said who="#M">I am grateful to
you for remembering my feelings.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Well, now I may go on.  Fred, you know, has taken his degree.  He has
worked his way so far, and now the question is, what is he to do?  That
question is so difficult that he is inclined to follow his father's
wishes and enter the Church, though you know better than I do that he
was quite set against that formerly.  I have questioned him on the
subject, and I confess I see no insuperable objection to his being a
clergyman, as things go.  He says that he could turn his mind to doing
his best in that vocation, on one condition.  If that condition were
fulfilled I would do my utmost in helping Fred on.  After a time—not,
of course, at first—he might be with me as my curate, and he would
have so much to do that his stipend would be nearly what I used to get
as vicar.  But I repeat that there is a condition without which all
this good cannot come to pass.  He has opened his heart to me, Miss
Garth, and asked me to plead for him.  The condition lies entirely in
your feeling.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB"> Mary looked so much moved,</said> that he said after a moment, <said who="#FB" direct="false" aloud="false">Let us walk a
little;</said> and when they were walking he added, <said who="#FB">To speak quite plainly,
Fred will not take any course which would lessen the chance that you
would consent to be his wife; but with that prospect, he will try his
best at anything you approve.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">I cannot possibly say that I will ever be his wife, Mr. Farebrother:
but I certainly never will be his wife if he becomes a clergyman.  What
you say is most generous and kind; I don't mean for a moment to correct
your judgment.  It is only that I have my girlish, mocking way of
looking at things,</said> said Mary, with a returning sparkle of playfulness
in her answer which only made its modesty more charming.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">He wishes me to report exactly what you think,</said> said Mr. Farebrother.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">I could not love a man who is ridiculous,</said> said Mary, not choosing to
go deeper.  <said who="#M">Fred has sense and knowledge enough to make him
respectable, if he likes, in some good worldly business, but I can
never imagine him preaching and exhorting, and pronouncing blessings,
and praying by the sick, without feeling as if I were looking at a
caricature.  His being a clergyman would be only for gentility's sake,
and I think there is nothing more contemptible than such imbecile
gentility.  I used to think that of Mr. Crowse, with his empty face and
neat umbrella, and mincing little speeches.  What right have such men
to represent Christianity—as if it were an institution for getting up
idiots genteelly—as if—</said> Mary checked herself. <said who="#M" direct="false" aloud="false"> She had been carried
along as if she had been speaking to Fred instead of Mr. Farebrother. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Young women are severe: they don't feel the stress of action as men
do, though perhaps I ought to make you an exception there.  But you
don't put Fred Vincy on so low a level as that?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">No, indeed, he has plenty of sense, but I think he would not show it
as a clergyman.  He would be a piece of professional affectation.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Then the answer is quite decided.  As a clergyman he could have no
hope?</said>
</P>

<P>
Mary shook her head.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">But if he braved all the difficulties of getting his bread in some
other way—will you give him the support of hope?  May he count on
winning you?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">I think Fred ought not to need telling again what I have already said
to him,</said> Mary answered, with a slight resentment in her manner.  <said who="#M">I
mean that he ought not to put such questions until he has done
something worthy, instead of saying that he could do it.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Farebrother was silent for a minute or more, and then, as they
turned and paused under the shadow of a maple at the end of a grassy
walk, said, <said who="#FB">I understand that you resist any attempt to fetter you,
but either your feeling for Fred Vincy excludes your entertaining
another attachment, or it does not: either he may count on your
remaining single until he shall have earned your hand, or he may in any
case be disappointed.  Pardon me, Mary—you know I used to catechise
you under that name—but when the state of a woman's affections touches
the happiness of another life—of more lives than one—I think it would
be the nobler course for her to be perfectly direct and open.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mary in her turn was silent, wondering not at Mr. Farebrother's manner
but at his tone, which had a grave restrained emotion in it.  When the
strange idea flashed across her that his words had reference to
himself, she was incredulous, and ashamed of entertaining it.  She had
never thought that any man could love her except Fred, who had espoused
her with the umbrella ring, when she wore socks and little strapped
shoes; <said who="#M" direct="false" aloud="false"> still less that she could be of any importance to Mr.
Farebrother, the cleverest man in her narrow circle.  She had only time
to feel that all this was hazy and perhaps illusory; but one thing was
clear and determined—her answer. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Since you think it my duty, Mr. Farebrother, I will tell you that I
have too strong a feeling for Fred to give him up for any one else.  I
should never be quite happy if I thought he was unhappy for the loss of
me.  It has taken such deep root in me—my gratitude to him for always
loving me best, and minding so much if I hurt myself, from the time
when we were very little.  I cannot imagine any new feeling coming to
make that weaker.  I should like better than anything to see him worthy
of every one's respect.  But please tell him I will not promise to
marry him till then: I should shame and grieve my father and mother.
He is free to choose some one else.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Then I have fulfilled my commission thoroughly,</said> said Mr. Farebrother,
putting out his hand to Mary, <said who="#FB">and I shall ride back to Middlemarch
forthwith.  With this prospect before him, we shall get Fred into the
right niche somehow, and I hope I shall live to join your hands.  God
bless you!</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Oh, please stay, and let me give you some tea,</said> said Mary.  Her eyes
filled with tears, for something indefinable, something like the
resolute suppression of a pain in Mr. Farebrother's manner, made her
feel suddenly miserable, as she had once felt when she saw her father's
hands trembling in a moment of trouble.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">No, my dear, no.  I must get back.</said>
</P>

<P>
In three minutes the Vicar was on horseback again, <said who="#FB" direct="false" aloud="false"> having gone
magnanimously through a duty much harder than the renunciation of
whist, or even than the writing of penitential meditations. </said>
</P>

<P CLASS="intro">
It is but a shallow haste which concludeth insincerity from

suckers whereby the belief and the conduct are wrought into

</P>

<BR/>

<P>
Mr. Bulstrode, when he was hoping to acquire a new interest in Lowick,
had naturally had an especial wish that the new clergyman should be one
whom he thoroughly approved; and he believed it to be a chastisement
and admonition directed to his own shortcomings and those of the nation
at large, that just about the time when he came in possession of the
deeds which made him the proprietor of Stone Court, Mr. Farebrother
<said who="#FB">read himself</said> into the quaint little church and preached his first
sermon to the congregation of farmers, laborers, and village artisans.
<said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> It was not that Mr. Bulstrode intended to frequent Lowick Church or to
reside at Stone Court for a good while to come: he had bought the
excellent farm and fine homestead simply as a retreat which he might
gradually enlarge as to the land and beautify as to the dwelling, until
it should be conducive to the divine glory that he should enter on it
as a residence, partially withdrawing from his present exertions in the
administration of business, and throwing more conspicuously on the side
of Gospel truth the weight of local landed proprietorship, which
Providence might increase by unforeseen occasions of purchase.  A
strong leading in this direction seemed to have been given in the
surprising facility of getting Stone Court, when every one had expected
that Mr. Rigg Featherstone would have clung to it as the Garden of
Eden. </said> <said who="#MrF" direct="false" aloud="false">That was what poor old Peter himself had expected; having often,
in imagination, looked up through the sods above him, and, unobstructed
by perspective, seen his frog-faced legatee enjoying the fine old
place to the perpetual surprise and disappointment of other survivors. </said>
</P>

<P>
<first> But how little we know what would make paradise for our neighbors! </first><first> We
judge from our own desires, and our neighbors themselves are not always
open enough even to throw out a hint of theirs.</first>  The cool and judicious
Joshua Rigg had not allowed his parent to perceive that Stone Court was
anything less than the chief good in his estimation, and he had
certainly wished to call it his own.  But as Warren Hastings looked at
gold and thought of buying Daylesford, so Joshua Rigg looked at Stone
Court and thought of buying gold.  He had a very distinct and intense
vision of his chief good, the vigorous greed which he had inherited
having taken a special form by dint of circumstance: and his chief good
was to be a moneychanger.  From his earliest employment as an
errand-boy in a seaport, he had looked through the windows of the
moneychangers as other boys look through the windows of the
pastry-cooks; the fascination had wrought itself gradually into a deep
special passion; he meant, when he had property, to do many things, one
of them being to marry a genteel young person; but these were all
accidents and joys that imagination could dispense with.  The one joy
after which his soul thirsted was to have a money-changer's shop on a
much-frequented quay, to have locks all round him of which he held the
keys, and to look sublimely cool as he handled the breeding coins of
all nations, while helpless Cupidity looked at him enviously from the
other side of an iron lattice.  The strength of that passion had been a
power enabling him to master all the knowledge necessary to gratify it.
And when others were thinking that he had settled at Stone Court for
life, Joshua himself was thinking that the moment now was not far off
when he should settle on the North Quay with the best appointments in
safes and locks.
</P>

<P>
<first> Enough.  We are concerned with looking at Joshua Rigg's sale of his
land from Mr. Bulstrode's point of view, and he interpreted it as a
cheering dispensation conveying perhaps a sanction to a purpose which
he had for some time entertained without external encouragement; he
interpreted it thus, but not too confidently, offering up his
thanksgiving in guarded phraseology. </first> His doubts did not arise from the
possible relations of the event to Joshua Rigg's destiny, which
belonged to the unmapped regions not taken under the providential
government, except perhaps in an imperfect colonial way; but they arose
from reflecting that this dispensation too might be a chastisement for
himself, as Mr. Farebrother's induction to the living clearly was.
</P>

<P>
<second> This was not what Mr. Bulstrode said to any man for the sake of
deceiving him: it was what he said to himself—it was as genuinely his
mode of explaining events as any theory of yours may be, if you happen
to disagree with him. </second> <first> For the egoism which enters into our theories
does not affect their sincerity; rather, the more our egoism is
satisfied, the more robust is our belief. </first>
</P>

<P>
However, whether for sanction or for chastisement, Mr. Bulstrode,
hardly fifteen months after the death of Peter Featherstone, had become
the proprietor of Stone Court, and what Peter would say <said>if he were
worthy to know,</said> had become an inexhaustible and consolatory subject of
conversation to his disappointed relatives.  The tables were now turned
on that dear brother departed, and to contemplate the frustration of
his cunning by the superior cunning of things in general was a cud of
delight to Solomon.  Mrs. Waule had a melancholy triumph in the proof
that it did not answer to make false Featherstones and cut off the
genuine; and Sister Martha receiving the news in the Chalky Flats said,
<said who="#Martha">Dear, dear! then the Almighty could have been none so pleased with the
almshouses after all.</said>
</P>

<P>
Affectionate Mrs. Bulstrode was particularly glad of the advantage
which her husband's health was likely to get from the purchase of Stone
Court.  Few days passed without his riding thither and looking over
some part of the farm with the bailiff, and the evenings were delicious
in that quiet spot, when the new hay-ricks lately set up were sending
forth odors to mingle with the breath of the rich old garden.  One
evening, while the sun was still above the horizon and burning in
golden lamps among the great walnut boughs, Mr. Bulstrode was pausing
on horseback outside the front gate waiting for Caleb Garth, who had
met him by appointment to give an opinion on a question of stable
drainage, and was now advising the bailiff in the rick-yard.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Bulstrode was conscious of being in a good spiritual frame and more
than usually serene, under the influence of his innocent recreation.
He was doctrinally convinced that there was a total absence of merit in
himself; but that doctrinal conviction may be held without pain when
the sense of demerit does not take a distinct shape in memory and
revive the tingling of shame or the pang of remorse. <first> Nay, it may be
held with intense satisfaction when the depth of our sinning is but a
measure for the depth of forgiveness, and a clenching proof that we are
peculiar instruments of the divine intention. </first> The memory has as many
moods as the temper, and shifts its scenery like a diorama.  At this
moment Mr. Bulstrode felt as if the sunshine were all one with that of
far-off evenings when he was a very young man and used to go out
preaching beyond Highbury. <said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> And he would willingly have had that
service of exhortation in prospect now.  The texts were there still,
and so was his own facility in expounding them. </said> His brief reverie was
interrupted by the return of Caleb Garth, who also was on horseback,
and was just shaking his bridle before starting, when he exclaimed—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrG">Bless my heart! what's this fellow in black coming along the lane?
He's like one of those men one sees about after the races.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Bulstrode turned his horse and looked along the lane, but made no
reply. <first> The comer was our slight acquaintance Mr. Raffles, whose
appearance presented no other change than such as was due to a suit of
black and a crape hat-band.</first> He was within three yards of the horseman
now, and they could see the flash of recognition in his face as he
whirled his stick upward, looking all the while at Mr. Bulstrode, and
at last exclaiming:—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">By Jove, Nick, it's you!  I couldn't be mistaken, though the
five-and-twenty years have played old Boguy with us both!  How are you,
eh? you didn't expect to see <emph rend="italics">me</emph> here.  Come, shake us by the hand.</said>
To say that Mr. Raffles' manner was rather excited would be only one
mode of saying that it was evening.  Caleb Garth could see that there
was a moment of struggle and hesitation in Mr. Bulstrode, but it ended
in his putting out his hand coldly to Raffles and saying—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">I did not indeed expect to see you in this remote country place.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">Well, it belongs to a stepson of mine,</said> said Raffles, adjusting
himself in a swaggering attitude.  <said who="#Raffles">I came to see him here before.  I'm
not so surprised at seeing you, old fellow, because I picked up a
letter—what you may call a providential thing.  It's uncommonly
fortunate I met you, though; for I don't care about seeing my stepson:
he's not affectionate, and his poor mother's gone now.  To tell the
truth, I came out of love to you, Nick: I came to get your address,
for—look here!</said>  Raffles drew a crumpled paper from his pocket.
</P>

<P>
Almost any other man than Caleb Garth might have been tempted to linger
on the spot for the sake of hearing all he could about a man whose
acquaintance with Bulstrode seemed to imply passages in the banker's
life so unlike anything that was known of him in Middlemarch that they
must have the nature of a secret to pique curiosity.  But Caleb was
peculiar: certain human tendencies which are commonly strong were
almost absent from his mind; and one of these was curiosity about
personal affairs.  Especially if there was anything discreditable to be
found out concerning another man, Caleb preferred not to know it; and
if he had to tell anybody under him that his evil doings were
discovered, he was more embarrassed than the culprit.  He now spurred
his horse, and saying, <said who="#MrG">I wish you good evening, Mr. Bulstrode; I must
be getting home,</said> set off at a trot.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">You didn't put your full address to this letter,</said> Raffles continued.
<said who="#Raffles">That was not like the first-rate man of business you used to be.  'The
Shrubs,'—they may be anywhere: you live near at hand, eh?—have cut
the London concern altogether—perhaps turned country squire—have a
rural mansion to invite me to.  Lord, how many years it is ago!  The
old lady must have been dead a pretty long while—gone to glory without
the pain of knowing how poor her daughter was, eh?  But, by Jove!
you're very pale and pasty, Nick.  Come, if you're going home, I'll
walk by your side.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Bulstrode's usual paleness had in fact taken an almost deathly hue.
Five minutes before, <said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> the expanse of his life had been submerged in its
evening sunshine which shone backward to its remembered morning: sin
seemed to be a question of doctrine and inward penitence, humiliation
an exercise of the closet, the bearing of his deeds a matter of private
vision adjusted solely by spiritual relations and conceptions of the
divine purposes.  And now, as if by some hideous magic, this loud red
figure had risen before him in unmanageable solidity—an incorporate
past which had not entered into his imagination of chastisements. </said> But
Mr. Bulstrode's thought was busy, and he was not a man to act or speak
rashly.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">I was going home,</said> he said, <said who="#B">but I can defer my ride a little.  And
you can, if you please, rest here.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">Thank you,</said> said Raffles, making a grimace.  <said who="#Raffles">I don't care now about
seeing my stepson.  I'd rather go home with you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">Your stepson, if Mr. Rigg Featherstone was he, is here no longer.  I
am master here now.</said>
</P>

<P>
Raffles opened wide eyes, and gave a long whistle of surprise, before
he said, <said who="#Raffles">Well then, I've no objection.  I've had enough walking from
the coach-road. I never was much of a walker, or rider either.  What I
like is a smart vehicle and a spirited cob.  I was always a little
heavy in the saddle.  What a pleasant surprise it must be to you to see
me, old fellow!</said> he continued, as they turned towards the house.  <said who="#Raffles">You
don't say so; but you never took your luck heartily—you were always
thinking of improving the occasion—you'd such a gift for improving
your luck.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Raffles seemed greatly to enjoy his own wit, and swung his leg in a
swaggering manner which was rather too much for his companion's
judicious patience.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">If I remember rightly,</said> Mr. Bulstrode observed, with chill anger, <said who="#B">our
acquaintance many years ago had not the sort of intimacy which you are
now assuming, Mr. Raffles.  Any services you desire of me will be the
more readily rendered if you will avoid a tone of familiarity which did
not lie in our former intercourse, and can hardly be warranted by more
than twenty years of separation.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">You don't like being called Nick?  Why, I always called you Nick in my
heart, and though lost to sight, to memory dear.  By Jove! my feelings
have ripened for you like fine old cognac.  I hope you've got some in
the house now.  Josh filled my flask well the last time.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Bulstrode had not yet fully learned that even the desire for cognac
was not stronger in Raffles than the desire to torment, and that a hint
of annoyance always served him as a fresh cue. <said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> But it was at least
clear that further objection was useless, </said> and Mr. Bulstrode, in giving
orders to the housekeeper for the accommodation of the guest, had a
resolute air of quietude.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> There was the comfort of thinking that this housekeeper had been in the
service of Rigg also, and might accept the idea that Mr. Bulstrode
entertained Raffles merely as a friend of her former master. </said>
</P>

<P>
When there was food and drink spread before his visitor in the
wainscoted parlor, and no witness in the room, Mr. Bulstrode said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">Your habits and mine are so different, Mr. Raffles, that we can hardly
enjoy each other's society.  The wisest plan for both of us will
therefore be to part as soon as possible.  Since you say that you
wished to meet me, you probably considered that you had some business
to transact with me.  But under the circumstances I will invite you to
remain here for the night, and I will myself ride over here early
to-morrow morning—before breakfast, in fact—when I can receive any
communication you have to make to me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">With all my heart,</said> said Raffles; <said who="#B">this is a comfortable place—a
little dull for a continuance; but I can put up with it for a night,
with this good liquor and the prospect of seeing you again in the
morning.  You're a much better host than my stepson was; but Josh owed
me a bit of a grudge for marrying his mother; and between you and me
there was never anything but kindness.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Bulstrode, hoping that the peculiar mixture of joviality and
sneering in Raffles' manner was a good deal the effect of drink, had
determined to wait till he was quite sober before he spent more words
upon him.  But he rode home with a terribly lucid vision of the
difficulty there would be in arranging any result that could be
permanently counted on with this man. <said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> It was inevitable that he should
wish to get rid of John Raffles, though his reappearance could not be
regarded as lying outside the divine plan.  The spirit of evil might
have sent him to threaten Mr. Bulstrode's subversion as an instrument
of good; but the threat must have been permitted, and was a
chastisement of a new kind. It was an hour of anguish for him very
different from the hours in which his struggle had been securely
private, and which had ended with a sense that his secret misdeeds were
pardoned and his services accepted.  Those misdeeds even when
committed—had they not been half sanctified by the singleness of his
desire to devote himself and all he possessed to the furtherance of the
divine scheme?  And was he after all to become a mere stone of
stumbling and a rock of offence?  For who would understand the work
within him?  Who would not, when there was the pretext of casting
disgrace upon him, confound his whole life and the truths he had
espoused, in one heap of obloquy? </said>
</P>

<P>
In his closest meditations the life-long habit of Mr. Bulstrode's mind
clad his most egoistic terrors in doctrinal references to superhuman
ends. <first> But even while we are talking and meditating about the earth's
orbit and the solar system, what we feel and adjust our movements to is
the stable earth and the changing day. </first> <first> And now within all the
automatic succession of theoretic phrases—distinct and inmost as the
shiver and the ache of oncoming fever when we are discussing abstract
pain, was the forecast of disgrace in the presence of his neighbors and
of his own wife. </first> For the pain, as well as the public estimate of
disgrace, depends on the amount of previous profession.  To men who
only aim at escaping felony, nothing short of the prisoner's dock is
disgrace.  But Mr. Bulstrode had aimed at being an eminent Christian.
</P>

<P>
It was not more than half-past seven in the morning when he again
reached Stone Court.  The fine old place never looked more like a
delightful home than at that moment; the great white lilies were in
flower, the nasturtiums, their pretty leaves all silvered with dew,
were running away over the low stone wall; the very noises all around
had a heart of peace within them.  But everything was spoiled for the
owner as he walked on the gravel in front and awaited the descent of
Mr. Raffles, with whom he was condemned to breakfast.
</P>

<P>
It was not long before they were seated together in the wainscoted
parlor over their tea and toast, which was as much as Raffles cared to
take at that early hour.  The difference between his morning and
evening self was not so great as his companion had imagined that it
might be; <said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> the delight in tormenting was perhaps even the stronger
because his spirits were rather less highly pitched.  Certainly his
manners seemed more disagreeable by the morning light. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">As I have little time to spare, Mr. Raffles,</said> said the banker, who
could hardly do more than sip his tea and break his toast without
eating it, <said who="#B">I shall be obliged if you will mention at once the ground
on which you wished to meet with me.  I presume that you have a home
elsewhere and will be glad to return to it.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">Why, if a man has got any heart, doesn't he want to see an old friend,
Nick?—I must call you Nick—we always did call you young Nick when we
knew you meant to marry the old widow.  Some said you had a handsome
family likeness to old Nick, but that was your mother's fault, calling
you Nicholas.  Aren't you glad to see me again?  I expected an invite
to stay with you at some pretty place.  My own establishment is broken
up now my wife's dead.  I've no particular attachment to any spot; I
would as soon settle hereabout as anywhere.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">May I ask why you returned from America?  I considered that the strong
wish you expressed to go there, when an adequate sum was furnished, was
tantamount to an engagement that you would remain there for life.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">Never knew that a wish to go to a place was the same thing as a wish
to stay.  But I did stay a matter of ten years; it didn't suit me to
stay any longer.  And I'm not going again, Nick.</said> Here Mr. Raffles
winked slowly as he looked at Mr. Bulstrode.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">Do you wish to be settled in any business?  What is your calling now?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">Thank you, my calling is to enjoy myself as much as I can.  I don't
care about working any more.  If I did anything it would be a little
travelling in the tobacco line—or something of that sort, which takes
a man into agreeable company.  But not without an independence to fall
back upon.  That's what I want: I'm not so strong as I was, Nick,
though I've got more color than you.  I want an independence.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">That could be supplied to you, if you would engage to keep at a
distance,</said> said Mr. Bulstrode, perhaps with a little too much eagerness
in his undertone.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">That must be as it suits my convenience,</said> said Raffles coolly.  <said who="#Raffles">I see
no reason why I shouldn't make a few acquaintances hereabout.  I'm not
ashamed of myself as company for anybody.  I dropped my portmanteau at
the turnpike when I got down—change of linen—genuine—honor bright—more
than fronts and wristbands; and with this suit of mourning, straps
and everything, I should do you credit among the nobs here.</said>  Mr.
Raffles had pushed away his chair and looked down at himself,
particularly at his straps.  His chief intention was to annoy
Bulstrode, but he really thought that his appearance now would produce
a good effect, and that he was not only handsome and witty, but clad in
a mourning style which implied solid connections.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">If you intend to rely on me in any way, Mr. Raffles,</said> said Bulstrode,
after a moment's pause, <said who="#B">you will expect to meet my wishes.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">Ah, to be sure,</said> said Raffles, with a mocking cordiality.  <said who="#Raffles">Didn't I
always do it?  Lord, you made a pretty thing out of me, and I got but
little.  I've often thought since, I might have done better by telling
the old woman that I'd found her daughter and her grandchild: it would
have suited my feelings better; I've got a soft place in my heart.  But
you've buried the old lady by this time, I suppose—it's all one to her
now.  And you've got your fortune out of that profitable business which
had such a blessing on it.  You've taken to being a nob, buying land,
being a country bashaw.  Still in the Dissenting line, eh?  Still
godly?  Or taken to the Church as more genteel?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> This time Mr. Raffles' slow wink and slight protrusion of his tongue
was worse than a nightmare, because it held the certitude that it was
not a nightmare, but a waking misery. </said> Mr. Bulstrode felt a shuddering
nausea, and did not speak, but was considering diligently whether he
should not leave Raffles to do as he would, and simply defy him as a
slanderer. <said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> The man would soon show himself disreputable enough to make
people disbelieve him.  <said who="#B">But not when he tells any ugly-looking truth
about <emph rend="italics">you</emph>,</said> said discerning consciousness.  And again: it seemed no
wrong to keep Raffles at a distance, but Mr. Bulstrode shrank from the
direct falsehood of denying true statements.  It was one thing to look
back on forgiven sins, nay, to explain questionable conformity to lax
customs, and another to enter deliberately on the necessity of
falsehood. </said>
</P>

<P>
But since Bulstrode did not speak, Raffles ran on, by way of using time
to the utmost.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">I've not had such fine luck as you, by Jove!  Things went confoundedly
with me in New York; those Yankees are cool hands, and a man of
gentlemanly feelings has no chance with them.  I married when I came
back—a nice woman in the tobacco trade—very fond of me—but the
trade was restricted, as we say.  She had been settled there a good
many years by a friend; but there was a son too much in the case.  Josh
and I never hit it off.  However, I made the most of the position, and
I've always taken my glass in good company.  It's been all on the
square with me; I'm as open as the day.  You won't take it ill of me
that I didn't look you up before.  I've got a complaint that makes me a
little dilatory.  I thought you were trading and praying away in London
still, and didn't find you there.  But you see I was sent to you,
Nick—perhaps for a blessing to both of us.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Raffles ended with a jocose snuffle: <said who="#Raffles" direct="false" aloud="false"> no man felt his intellect more
superior to religious cant.  And if the cunning which calculates on the
meanest feelings in men could be called intellect, he had his share,
for under the blurting rallying tone with which he spoke to Bulstrode,
there was an evident selection of statements, as if they had been so
many moves at chess. </said> Meanwhile Bulstrode had determined on his move,
and he said, with gathered resolution—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">You will do well to reflect, Mr. Raffles, that it is possible for a
man to overreach himself in the effort to secure undue advantage.
Although I am not in any way bound to you, I am willing to supply you
with a regular annuity—in quarterly payments—so long as you fulfil a
promise to remain at a distance from this neighborhood.  It is in your
power to choose.  If you insist on remaining here, even for a short
time, you will get nothing from me.  I shall decline to know you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">Ha, ha!</said> said Raffles, with an affected explosion, <said who="#Raffles">that reminds me of
a droll dog of a thief who declined to know the constable.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">Your allusions are lost on me sir,</said> said Bulstrode, with white heat;
<said who="#B">the law has no hold on me either through your agency or any other.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">You can't understand a joke, my good fellow.  I only meant that I
should never decline to know you.  But let us be serious.  Your
quarterly payment won't quite suit me.  I like my freedom.</said>
</P>

<P>
Here Raffles rose and stalked once or twice up and down the room,
swinging his leg, and assuming an air of masterly meditation.  At last
he stopped opposite Bulstrode, and said, <said who="#Raffles">I'll tell you what!  Give us
a couple of hundreds—come, that's modest—and I'll go away—honor
bright!—pick up my portmanteau and go away.  But I shall not give up
my liberty for a dirty annuity.  I shall come and go where I like.
Perhaps it may suit me to stay away, and correspond with a friend;
perhaps not.  Have you the money with you?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">No, I have one hundred,</said> said Bulstrode, feeling the immediate
riddance too great a relief to be rejected on the ground of future
uncertainties.  <said who="#B">I will forward you the other if you will mention an
address.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">No, I'll wait here till you bring it,</said> said Raffles.  <said who="#Raffles">I'll take a
stroll and have a snack, and you'll be back by that time.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Bulstrode's sickly body, shattered by the agitations he had gone
through since the last evening, made him feel abjectly in the power of
this loud invulnerable man.  At that moment he snatched at a temporary
repose to be won on any terms.  He was rising to do what Raffles
suggested, when the latter said, lifting up his finger as if with a
sudden recollection—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">I did have another look after Sarah again, though I didn't tell you;
I'd a tender conscience about that pretty young woman.  I didn't find
her, but I found out her husband's name, and I made a note of it.  But
hang it, I lost my pocketbook.  However, if I heard it, I should know
it again.  I've got my faculties as if I was in my prime, but names
wear out, by Jove!  Sometimes I'm no better than a confounded tax-paper
before the names are filled in.  However, if I hear of her and her
family, you shall know, Nick.  You'd like to do something for her, now
she's your step-daughter.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">Doubtless,</said> said Mr. Bulstrode, with the usual steady look of his
light-gray eyes; <said who="#B">though that might reduce my power of assisting you.</said>
</P>

<P>
As he walked out of the room, Raffles winked slowly at his back, and
then turned towards the window to watch the banker riding away—virtually
at his command.  His lips first curled with a smile and then opened
with a short triumphant laugh.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#RafB">But what the deuce was the name?</said> he presently said, half aloud,
scratching his head, and wrinkling his brows horizontally.  He had not
really cared or thought about this point of forgetfulness until it
occurred to him in his invention of annoyances for Bulstrode.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Raffles">It began with L; it was almost all l's I fancy,</said> he went on, with a
sense that he was getting hold of the slippery name.  But the hold was
too slight, and he soon got tired of this mental chase; for few men
were more impatient of private occupation or more in need of making
themselves continually heard than Mr. Raffles.  He preferred using his
time in pleasant conversation with the bailiff and the housekeeper,
from whom he gathered as much as he wanted to know about Mr.
Bulstrode's position in Middlemarch.
</P>

<P>
After all, however, there was a dull space of time which needed
relieving with bread and cheese and ale, and when he was seated alone
with these resources in the wainscoted parlor, he suddenly slapped his
knee, and exclaimed, <said who="#Raffles">Ladislaw!</said>  That action of memory which he had
tried to set going, and had abandoned in despair, had suddenly
completed itself without conscious effort—a common experience,
agreeable as a completed sneeze, even if the name remembered is of no
value.  Raffles immediately took out his pocket-book, and wrote down
the name, not because he expected to use it, but merely for the sake of
not being at a loss if he ever did happen to want it. <said who="#Raffles" direct="false" aloud="false"> He was not going
to tell Bulstrode: there was no actual good in telling, and to a mind
like that of Mr. Raffles there is always probable good in a secret. </said>
</P>

<P>
He was satisfied with his present success, and by three o'clock that
day he had taken up his portmanteau at the turnpike and mounted the
coach, relieving Mr. Bulstrode's eyes of an ugly black spot on the
landscape at Stone Court, but not relieving him of the dread that the
black spot might reappear and become inseparable even from the vision
of his hearth.
