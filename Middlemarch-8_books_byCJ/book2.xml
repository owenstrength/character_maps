<epigraph>
              1st Gent. How class your man?—as better than the most,
                           Or, seeming better, worse beneath that cloak?
                           As saint or knave, pilgrim or hypocrite?
              2d Gent.  Nay, tell me how you class your wealth of books
                           The drifted relics of all time.
                           As well sort them at once by size and livery:
                           Vellum, tall copies, and the common calf
                           Will hardly cover more diversity
                           Than all your labels cunningly devised
                           To class your unread authors.

<said who="#MrV" direct="false" aloud="false"> In consequence of what he had heard from Fred, Mr. Vincy determined to
speak with Mr. Bulstrode in his private room at the Bank at half-past
one, when he was usually free from other callers. </said> But a visitor had
come in at one o'clock, and Mr. Bulstrode had so much to say to him,
that there was little chance of the interview being over in half an
hour.  The banker's speech was fluent, but it was also copious, and he
used up an appreciable amount of time in brief meditative pauses.  Do
not imagine his sickly aspect to have been of the yellow, black-haired
sort: he had a pale blond skin, thin gray-besprinkled brown hair,
light-gray eyes, and a large forehead.  Loud men called his subdued
tone an undertone, and sometimes implied that it was inconsistent with
openness; though there seems to be no reason why a loud man should not
be given to concealment of anything except his own voice, unless it can
be shown that Holy Writ has placed the seat of candor in the lungs.
Mr. Bulstrode had also a deferential bending attitude in listening, and
an apparently fixed attentiveness in his eyes which made those persons
who thought themselves worth hearing infer that he was seeking the
utmost improvement from their discourse.  Others, who expected to make
no great figure, disliked this kind of moral lantern turned on them.
 <second> If you are not proud of your cellar, there is no thrill of satisfaction
in seeing your guest hold up his wine-glass to the light and look
judicial. </second>Such joys are reserved for conscious merit. <said who="#MM" direct="false" aloud="false"> Hence Mr.
Bulstrode's close attention was not agreeable to the publicans and
sinners in Middlemarch; it was attributed by some to his being a
Pharisee, and by others to his being Evangelical. Less superficial
reasoners among them wished to know who his father and grandfather
were, observing that five-and-twenty years ago nobody had ever heard of
a Bulstrode in Middlemarch. </said> <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> To his present visitor, Lydgate, the
scrutinizing look was a matter of indifference: he simply formed an
unfavorable opinion of the banker's constitution, and concluded that he
had an eager inward life with little enjoyment of tangible things. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">I shall be exceedingly obliged if you will look in on me here
occasionally, Mr. Lydgate,</said> the banker observed, after a brief pause.
<said who="#B">If, as I dare to hope, I have the privilege of finding you a valuable
coadjutor in the interesting matter of hospital management, there will
be many questions which we shall need to discuss in private.  As to the
new hospital, which is nearly finished, I shall consider what you have
said about the advantages of the special destination for fevers.  The
decision will rest with me, for though Lord Medlicote has given the
land and timber for the building, he is not disposed to give his
personal attention to the object.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">There are few things better worth the pains in a provincial town like
this,</said> said Lydgate.  <said who="#Lyd">A fine fever hospital in addition to the old
infirmary might be the nucleus of a medical school here, when once we
get our medical reforms; and what would do more for medical education
than the spread of such schools over the country?  A born provincial
man who has a grain of public spirit as well as a few ideas, should do
what he can to resist the rush of everything that is a little better
than common towards London.  Any valid professional aims may often find
a freer, if not a richer field, in the provinces.</said>
</P>

<P>
One of Lydgate's gifts was a voice habitually deep and sonorous, yet
capable of becoming very low and gentle at the right moment.  About his
ordinary bearing there was a certain fling, a fearless expectation of
success, a confidence in his own powers and integrity much fortified by
contempt for petty obstacles or seductions of which he had had no
experience.  But this proud openness was made lovable by an expression
<<<<<<< HEAD
of unaffected good-will. <said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mr. Bulstrode perhaps liked him the better for
the difference between them in pitch and manners; he certainly liked
him the better, as Rosamond did, for being a stranger in Middlemarch.
One can begin so many things with a new person!—even begin to be a
better man. </said>

</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">I shall rejoice to furnish your zeal with fuller opportunities,</said> Mr.
Bulstrode answered; <said who="#B">I mean, by confiding to you the superintendence of
my new hospital, should a maturer knowledge favor that issue, for I am
determined that so great an object shall not be shackled by our two
physicians.  Indeed, I am encouraged to consider your advent to this
town as a gracious indication that a more manifest blessing is now to
be awarded to my efforts, which have hitherto been much withstood.
With regard to the old infirmary, we have gained the initial point—I
mean your election.  And now I hope you will not shrink from incurring
a certain amount of jealousy and dislike from your professional
brethren by presenting yourself as a reformer.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I will not profess bravery,</said> said Lydgate, smiling, <said who="#Lyd">but I acknowledge
a good deal of pleasure in fighting, and I should not care for my
profession, if I did not believe that better methods were to be found
and enforced there as well as everywhere else.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">The standard of that profession is low in Middlemarch, my dear sir,</said>
said the banker.  <said who="#B">I mean in knowledge and skill; not in social status,
for our medical men are most of them connected with respectable
townspeople here.  My own imperfect health has induced me to give some
attention to those palliative resources which the divine mercy has
placed within our reach.  I have consulted eminent men in the
metropolis, and I am painfully aware of the backwardness under which
medical treatment labors in our provincial districts.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Yes;—with our present medical rules and education, one must be
satisfied now and then to meet with a fair practitioner.  As to all the
higher questions which determine the starting-point of a diagnosis—as
to the philosophy of medical evidence—any glimmering of these can only
come from a scientific culture of which country practitioners have
usually no more notion than the man in the moon.</said>

<said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mr. Bulstrode, bending and looking intently, found the form which
Lydgate had given to his agreement not quite suited to his
comprehension.  Under such circumstances a judicious man changes the
topic and enters on ground where his own gifts may be more useful. </said>

</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">I am aware,</said> he said, <said who="#B">that the peculiar bias of medical ability is
towards material means.  Nevertheless, Mr. Lydgate, I hope we shall not
vary in sentiment as to a measure in which you are not likely to be
actively concerned, but in which your sympathetic concurrence may be an
aid to me.  You recognize, I hope; the existence of spiritual interests
in your patients?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Certainly I do.  But those words are apt to cover different meanings
to different minds.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">Precisely.  And on such subjects wrong teaching is as fatal as no
teaching.  Now a point which I have much at heart to secure is a new
regulation as to clerical attendance at the old infirmary.  The
building stands in Mr. Farebrother's parish.  You know Mr. Farebrother?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I have seen him.  He gave me his vote.  I must call to thank him.  He
seems a very bright pleasant little fellow.  And I understand he is a
naturalist.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">Mr. Farebrother, my dear sir, is a man deeply painful to contemplate.
I suppose there is not a clergyman in this country who has greater
talents.</said>  Mr. Bulstrode paused and looked meditative.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd"> I have not yet been pained by finding any excessive talent in
Middlemarch,</said> said Lydgate, bluntly.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">What I desire,</said> Mr. Bulstrode continued, looking still more serious,
<said who="#B">is that Mr. Farebrother's attendance at the hospital should be
superseded by the appointment of a chaplain—of Mr. Tyke, in fact—and
that no other spiritual aid should be called in.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">As a medical man I could have no opinion on such a point unless I knew
Mr. Tyke, and even then I should require to know the cases in which he
was applied.</said>  Lydgate smiled, but he was bent on being circumspect.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">Of course you cannot enter fully into the merits of this measure at
present.  But </said> —here Mr. Bulstrode began to speak with a more chiselled
emphasis—<said who="#B"> the subject is likely to be referred to the medical board of
the infirmary, and what I trust I may ask of you is, that in virtue of
the cooperation between us which I now look forward to, you will not,
so far as you are concerned, be influenced by my opponents in this
matter.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I hope I shall have nothing to do with clerical disputes,</said> said
Lydgate.  <said who="#Lyd">The path I have chosen is to work well in my own profession.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">My responsibility, Mr. Lydgate, is of a broader kind.  With me,
indeed, this question is one of sacred accountableness; whereas with my
opponents, I have good reason to say that it is an occasion for
gratifying a spirit of worldly opposition.  But I shall not therefore
drop one iota of my convictions, or cease to identify myself with that
truth which an evil generation hates.  I have devoted myself to this
object of hospital-improvement, but I will boldly confess to you, Mr.
Lydgate, that I should have no interest in hospitals if I believed that
nothing more was concerned therein than the cure of mortal diseases.  I
have another ground of action, and in the face of persecution I will
not conceal it.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Bulstrode's voice had become a loud and agitated whisper as he said
the last words.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">There we certainly differ,</said> said Lydgate. <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> But he was not sorry that
the door was now opened, and Mr. Vincy was announced.  That florid
sociable personage was become more interesting to him since he had seen
Rosamond.  Not that, like her, he had been weaving any future in which
their lots were united; but a man naturally remembers a charming girl
with pleasure, and is willing to dine where he may see her again.
Before he took leave, Mr. Vincy had given that invitation which he had
been <said>in no hurry about,</said> for Rosamond at breakfast had mentioned that
she thought her uncle Featherstone had taken the new doctor into great
favor. </said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Bulstrode, alone with his brother-in-law, poured himself out a
glass of water, and opened a sandwich-box.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">I cannot persuade you to adopt my regimen, Vincy?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV">No, no; I've no opinion of that system.  Life wants padding,</said> said Mr.
Vincy, unable to omit his portable theory.  <said who="#MrV">However,</said> he went on,
accenting the word, as if to dismiss all irrelevance, <said who="#MrV">what I came here
to talk about was a little affair of my young scapegrace, Fred's.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">That is a subject on which you and I are likely to take quite as
different views as on diet, Vincy.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV">I hope not this time.</said> <said who="#MrV" direct="false" aloud="false">  (Mr. Vincy was resolved to be good-humored.) </said>
<said who="#MrV">The fact is, it's about a whim of old Featherstone's. Somebody has
been cooking up a story out of spite, and telling it to the old man, to
try to set him against Fred.  He's very fond of Fred, and is likely to
do something handsome for him; indeed he has as good as told Fred that
he means to leave him his land, and that makes other people jealous.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">Vincy, I must repeat, that you will not get any concurrence from me as
to the course you have pursued with your eldest son.  It was entirely
from worldly vanity that you destined him for the Church: with a family
of three sons and four daughters, you were not warranted in devoting
money to an expensive education which has succeeded in nothing but in
giving him extravagant idle habits.  You are now reaping the
consequences.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV" direct="false" aloud="false"> To point out other people's errors was a duty that Mr. Bulstrode rarely
shrank from, but Mr. Vincy was not equally prepared to be patient.
When a man has the immediate prospect of being mayor, and is ready, in
the interests of commerce, to take up a firm attitude on politics
generally, he has naturally a sense of his importance to the framework
of things which seems to throw questions of private conduct into the
background.  And this particular reproof irritated him more than any
other.  It was eminently superfluous to him to be told that he was
reaping the consequences.  But he felt his neck under Bulstrode's yoke;
and though he usually enjoyed kicking, he was anxious to refrain from
that relief. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV">As to that, Bulstrode, it's no use going back.  I'm not one of your
pattern men, and I don't pretend to be.  I couldn't foresee everything
in the trade; there wasn't a finer business in Middlemarch than ours,
and the lad was clever.  My poor brother was in the Church, and would
have done well—had got preferment already, but that stomach fever took
him off: else he might have been a dean by this time.  I think I was
justified in what I tried to do for Fred.  If you come to religion, it
seems to me a man shouldn't want to carve out his meat to an ounce
beforehand:—one must trust a little to Providence and be generous.
It's a good British feeling to try and raise your family a little: in
my opinion, it's a father's duty to give his sons a fine chance.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">I don't wish to act otherwise than as your best friend, Vincy, when I
say that what you have been uttering just now is one mass of
worldliness and inconsistent folly.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV">Very well,</said> said Mr. Vincy, kicking in spite of resolutions, <said who="#MrV">I never
professed to be anything but worldly; and, what's more, I don't see
anybody else who is not worldly.  I suppose you don't conduct business
on what you call unworldly principles.  The only difference I see is
that one worldliness is a little bit honester than another.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">This kind of discussion is unfruitful, Vincy,</said> said Mr. Bulstrode,
who, finishing his sandwich, had thrown himself back in his chair, and
shaded his eyes as if weary.  <said who="#B">You had some more particular business.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV">Yes, yes.  The long and short of it is, somebody has told old
Featherstone, giving you as the authority, that Fred has been borrowing
or trying to borrow money on the prospect of his land.  Of course you
never said any such nonsense.  But the old fellow will insist on it
that Fred should bring him a denial in your handwriting; that is, just
a bit of a note saying you don't believe a word of such stuff, either
of his having borrowed or tried to borrow in such a fool's way.  I
suppose you can have no objection to do that.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">Pardon me.  I have an objection.  I am by no means sure that your son,
in his recklessness and ignorance—I will use no severer word—has not
tried to raise money by holding out his future prospects, or even that
some one may not have been foolish enough to supply him on so vague a
presumption: there is plenty of such lax money-lending as of other
folly in the world.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV">But Fred gives me his honor that he has never borrowed money on the
pretence of any understanding about his uncle's land.  He is not a
liar.  I don't want to make him better than he is.  I have blown him up
well—nobody can say I wink at what he does.  But he is not a liar.
And I should have thought—but I may be wrong—that there was no
religion to hinder a man from believing the best of a young fellow,
when you don't know worse.  It seems to me it would be a poor sort of
religion to put a spoke in his wheel by refusing to say you don't
believe such harm of him as you've got no good reason to believe.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">I am not at all sure that I should be befriending your son by
smoothing his way to the future possession of Featherstone's property.
I cannot regard wealth as a blessing to those who use it simply as a
harvest for this world.  You do not like to hear these things, Vincy,
but on this occasion I feel called upon to tell you that I have no
motive for furthering such a disposition of property as that which you
refer to.  I do not shrink from saying that it will not tend to your
son's eternal welfare or to the glory of God.  Why then should you
expect me to pen this kind of affidavit, which has no object but to
keep up a foolish partiality and secure a foolish bequest?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV">If you mean to hinder everybody from having money but saints and
evangelists, you must give up some profitable partnerships, that's all
I can say,</said> Mr. Vincy burst out very bluntly.  <said who="#MrV">It may be for the glory
of God, but it is not for the glory of the Middlemarch trade, that
Plymdale's house uses those blue and green dyes it gets from the
Brassing manufactory; they rot the silk, that's all I know about it.
Perhaps if other people knew so much of the profit went to the glory of
God, they might like it better.  But I don't mind so much about that—I
could get up a pretty row, if I chose.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Bulstrode paused a little before he answered.  <said who="#B">You pain me very
much by speaking in this way, Vincy.  I do not expect you to understand
my grounds of action—it is not an easy thing even to thread a path for
principles in the intricacies of the world—still less to make the
thread clear for the careless and the scoffing.  You must remember, if
you please, that I stretch my tolerance towards you as my wife's
brother, and that it little becomes you to complain of me as
withholding material help towards the worldly position of your family.
I must remind you that it is not your own prudence or judgment that has
enabled you to keep your place in the trade.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV">Very likely not; but you have been no loser by my trade yet,</said> said Mr.
Vincy, thoroughly nettled (a result which was seldom much retarded by
previous resolutions). <said who="#MrV">And when you married Harriet, I don't see how
you could expect that our families should not hang by the same nail.
If you've changed your mind, and want my family to come down in the
world, you'd better say so.  I've never changed; I'm a plain Churchman
now, just as I used to be before doctrines came up.  I take the world
as I find it, in trade and everything else.  I'm contented to be no
worse than my neighbors.  But if you want us to come down in the world,
say so.  I shall know better what to do then.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B"> You talk unreasonably.  Shall you come down in the world for want of
this letter about your son?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV">Well, whether or not, I consider it very unhandsome of you to refuse
it.  Such doings may be lined with religion, but outside they have a
nasty, dog-in-the-manger look.  You might as well slander Fred: it
comes pretty near to it when you refuse to say you didn't set a slander
going.  It's this sort of thing—this tyrannical spirit, wanting to
play bishop and banker everywhere—it's this sort of thing makes a
man's name stink.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">Vincy, if you insist on quarrelling with me, it will be exceedingly
painful to Harriet as well as myself,</said> said Mr. Bulstrode, with a
trifle more eagerness and paleness than usual.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV">I don't want to quarrel.  It's for my interest—and perhaps for yours
too—that we should be friends.  I bear you no grudge; I think no worse
of you than I do of other people.  A man who half starves himself, and
goes the length in family prayers, and so on, that you do, believes in
his religion whatever it may be: you could turn over your capital just
as fast with cursing and swearing:—plenty of fellows do.  You like to
be master, there's no denying that; you must be first chop in heaven,
else you won't like it much.  But you're my sister's husband, and we
ought to stick together; and if I know Harriet, she'll consider it your
fault if we quarrel because you strain at a gnat in this way, and
refuse to do Fred a good turn.  And I don't mean to say I shall bear it
well.  I consider it unhandsome.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mr. Vincy rose, began to button his great-coat, and looked steadily at
his brother-in-law, meaning to imply a demand for a decisive answer. </said>
</P>

<P>
This was not the first time that Mr. Bulstrode had begun by admonishing
Mr. Vincy, and had ended by seeing a very unsatisfactory reflection of
himself in the coarse unflattering mirror which that manufacturer's
mind presented to the subtler lights and shadows of his fellow-men; and
perhaps his experience ought to have warned him how the scene would
end.  But a full-fed fountain will be generous with its waters even in
the rain, when they are worse than useless; and a fine fount of
admonition is apt to be equally irrepressible.
</P>

<P>
It was not in Mr. Bulstrode's nature to comply directly in consequence
of uncomfortable suggestions.  Before changing his course, he always
needed to shape his motives and bring them into accordance with his
habitual standard.  He said, at last—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">I will reflect a little, Vincy.  I will mention the subject to
Harriet.  I shall probably send you a letter.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV">Very well.  As soon as you can, please.  I hope it will all be settled
before I see you to-morrow.</said>

<BR/>

<P>
Mr. Bulstrode's consultation of Harriet seemed to have had the effect
desired by Mr. Vincy, for early the next morning a letter came which
Fred could carry to Mr. Featherstone as the required testimony.
</P>

<P>
The old gentleman was staying in bed on account of the cold weather,
and as Mary Garth was not to be seen in the sitting-room, Fred went
up-stairs immediately and presented the letter to his uncle, who,
propped up comfortably on a bed-rest, was not less able than usual to
enjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating
mankind.  He put on his spectacles to read the letter, pursing up his
lips and drawing down their corners.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF"><i>Under the circumstances I will not decline to state my
conviction</i>—tchah! what fine words the fellow puts!  He's as fine as an
auctioneer—<i>that your son Frederic has not obtained any advance of
money on bequests promised by Mr. Featherstone</i>—promised? who said I
had ever promised?  I promise nothing—I shall make codicils as long as
I like—<i>and that considering the nature of such a proceeding, it is
unreasonable to presume that a young man of sense and character would
attempt it</i>—ah, but the gentleman doesn't say you are a young man of
sense and character, mark you that, sir!—<i>As to my own concern with any
report of such a nature, I distinctly affirm that I never made any
statement to the effect that your son had borrowed money on any
property that might accrue to him on Mr. Featherstone's demise</i>—bless
my heart! 'property'—accrue—demise!  Lawyer Standish is nothing to
him.  He couldn't speak finer if he wanted to borrow.  Well,</said> Mr.
Featherstone here looked over his spectacles at Fred, while he handed
back the letter to him with a contemptuous gesture, <said who="#MrF">you don't suppose
I believe a thing because Bulstrode writes it out fine, eh?</said>
</P>

<P>
Fred colored.  <said who="#F"> You wished to have the letter, sir.  I should think it
very likely that Mr. Bulstrode's denial is as good as the authority
which told you what he denies.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF">Every bit.  I never said I believed either one or the other.  And now
what d' you expect?</said> said Mr. Featherstone, curtly, keeping on his
spectacles, but withdrawing his hands under his wraps.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">I expect nothing, sir.</said>  Fred with difficulty restrained himself from
venting his irritation.  <said who="#F">I came to bring you the letter.  If you like
I will bid you good morning.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF">Not yet, not yet.  Ring the bell; I want missy to come.</said>
</P>

<P>
It was a servant who came in answer to the bell.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF">Tell missy to come!</said> said Mr. Featherstone, impatiently.  <said who="#MrF">What
business had she to go away?</said>  He spoke in the same tone when Mary came.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF">Why couldn't you sit still here till I told you to go? I want my
waistcoat now.  I told you always to put it on the bed.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mary's eyes looked rather red, as if she had been crying.  It was clear
that Mr. Featherstone was in one of his most snappish humors this
morning, and though Fred had now the prospect of receiving the
much-needed present of money, he would have preferred being free to
turn round on the old tyrant and tell him that Mary Garth was too good
to be at his beck. Though Fred had risen as she entered the room, she
had barely noticed him, and looked as if her nerves were quivering with
the expectation that something would be thrown at her. </said>  But she never
had anything worse than words to dread.  When she went to reach the
waistcoat from a peg, Fred went up to her and said, <said who="#F">Allow me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF">Let it alone!  You bring it, missy, and lay it down here,</said> said Mr.
Featherstone.  <said who="#MrF">Now you go away again till I call you,</said> he added, when
the waistcoat was laid down by him.  It was usual with him to season
his pleasure in showing favor to one person by being especially
disagreeable to another, and Mary was always at hand to furnish the
condiment.  When his own relatives came she was treated better.  Slowly
he took out a bunch of keys from the waistcoat pocket, and slowly he
drew forth a tin box which was under the bed-clothes.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF">You expect I am going to give you a little fortune, eh?</said> he said,
looking above his spectacles and pausing in the act of opening the lid.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Not at all, sir.  You were good enough to speak of making me a present
the other day, else, of course, I should not have thought of the
matter.</said>  <said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false"> But Fred was of a hopeful disposition, and a vision had
presented itself of a sum just large enough to deliver him from a
certain anxiety.  When Fred got into debt, it always seemed to him
highly probable that something or other—he did not necessarily
conceive what—would come to pass enabling him to pay in due time.  And
now that the providential occurrence was apparently close at hand, it
would have been sheer absurdity to think that the supply would be short
of the need: as absurd as a faith that believed in half a miracle for
want of strength to believe in a whole one. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false"> The deep-veined hands fingered many bank-notes one after the other,
laying them down flat again, while Fred leaned back in his chair,
scorning to look eager.  He held himself to be a gentleman at heart,
and did not like courting an old fellow for his money.  At last, Mr.
Featherstone eyed him again over his spectacles and presented him with
a little sheaf of notes: Fred could see distinctly that there were but
five, as the less significant edges gaped towards him.  But then, each
might mean fifty pounds. </said> He took them, saying—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">I am very much obliged to you, sir,</said> and was going to roll them up
without seeming to think of their value.  But this did not suit Mr.
Featherstone, who was eying him intently.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF">Come, don't you think it worth your while to count 'em?  You take
money like a lord; I suppose you lose it like one.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">I thought I was not to look a gift-horse in the mouth, sir.  But I
shall be very happy to count them.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false"> Fred was not so happy, however, after he had counted them.  For they
actually presented the absurdity of being less than his hopefulness had
decided that they must be.  What can the fitness of things mean, if not
their fitness to a man's expectations? Failing this, absurdity and
atheism gape behind him.  The collapse for Fred was severe when he
found that he held no more than five twenties, and his share in the
higher education of this country did not seem to help him. </said>
Nevertheless he said, with rapid changes in his fair complexion—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">It is very handsome of you, sir.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF">I should think it is,</said> said Mr. Featherstone, locking his box and
replacing it, then taking off his spectacles deliberately, and at
length, as if his inward meditation had more deeply convinced him,
repeating, <said who="#MrF">I should think it handsome.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">I assure you, sir, I am very grateful,</said> said Fred, who had had time to
recover his cheerful air.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF">So you ought to be.  You want to cut a figure in the world, and I
reckon Peter Featherstone is the only one you've got to trust to.</said> <said who="#MrF" direct="false" aloud="false"> Here
the old man's eyes gleamed with a curiously mingled satisfaction in the
consciousness that this smart young fellow relied upon him, and that
the smart young fellow was rather a fool for doing so. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F"> <said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false">Yes, indeed: I was not born to very splendid chances.  Few men have
been more cramped than I have been,</said> said Fred, with some sense of
surprise at his own virtue, considering how hardly he was dealt with. </said>
<said who="#F">It really seems a little too bad to have to ride a broken-winded
hunter, and see men, who, are not half such good judges as yourself,
able to throw away any amount of money on buying bad bargains.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF">Well, you can buy yourself a fine hunter now.  Eighty pound is enough
for that, I reckon—and you'll have twenty pound over to get yourself
out of any little scrape,</said> said Mr. Featherstone, chuckling slightly.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F"> <said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false">You are very good, sir,</said> said Fred, with a fine sense of contrast
between the words and his feeling. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF">Ay, rather a better uncle than your fine uncle Bulstrode.  You won't
get much out of his spekilations, I think.  He's got a pretty strong
string round your father's leg, by what I hear, eh?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">My father never tells me anything about his affairs, sir.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF">Well, he shows some sense there.  But other people find 'em out
without his telling.  <emph rend="italics">He'll</emph> never have much to leave you: he'll
most-like die without a will—he's the sort of man to do it—let 'em
make him mayor of Middlemarch as much as they like.  But you won't get
much by his dying without a will, though you <emph rend="italics">are</emph> the eldest son.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false"> Fred thought that Mr. Featherstone had never been so disagreeable
before. True, he had never before given him quite so much money at
once. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Shall I destroy this letter of Mr. Bulstrode's, sir?</said> said Fred,
rising with the letter as if he would put it in the fire.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrF">Ay, ay, I don't want it.  It's worth no money to me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false"> Fred carried the letter to the fire, and thrust the poker through it
with much zest.  He longed to get out of the room, but he was a little
ashamed before his inner self, as well as before his uncle, to run away
immediately after pocketing the money.  Presently, the farm-bailiff
came up to give his master a report, and Fred, to his unspeakable
relief, was dismissed with the injunction to come again soon. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false"> He had longed not only to be set free from his uncle, but also to find
Mary Garth. She was now in her usual place by the fire, with sewing in
her hands and a book open on the little table by her side.  Her eyelids
had lost some of their redness now, and she had her usual air of
self-command. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Am I wanted up-stairs?</said> she said, half rising as Fred entered.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">No; I am only dismissed, because Simmons is gone up.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mary sat down again, and resumed her work.  She was certainly treating
him with more indifference than usual: she did not know how
affectionately indignant he had felt on her behalf up-stairs. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">May I stay here a little, Mary, or shall I bore you?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Pray sit down,</said> said Mary; <said who="#M">you will not be so heavy a bore as Mr.
John Waule, who was here yesterday, and he sat down without asking my
leave.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Poor fellow!  I think he is in love with you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">I am not aware of it.  And to me it is one of the most odious things
in a girl's life, that there must always be some supposition of falling
in love coming between her and any man who is kind to her, and to whom
she is grateful.  I should have thought that I, at least, might have
been safe from all that.  I have no ground for the nonsensical vanity
of fancying everybody who comes near me is in love with me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mary did not mean to betray any feeling, but in spite of herself she
ended in a tremulous tone of vexation. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Confound John Waule!  I did not mean to make you angry.  I didn't know
you had any reason for being grateful to me.  I forgot what a great
service you think it if any one snuffs a candle for you.</said> <said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false"> Fred also had
his pride, and was not going to show that he knew what had called forth
this outburst of Mary's. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Oh, I am not angry, except with the ways of the world.  I do like to
be spoken to as if I had common-sense. I really often feel as if I
could understand a little more than I ever hear even from young
gentlemen who have been to college.</said>  Mary had recovered, and she spoke
with a suppressed rippling under-current of laughter pleasant to hear.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">I don't care how merry you are at my expense this morning,</said> said Fred,
<said who="#F">I thought you looked so sad when you came up-stairs. It is a shame you
should stay here to be bullied in that way.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Oh, I have an easy life—by comparison.  I have tried being a teacher,
and I am not fit for that: my mind is too fond of wandering on its own
way.  I think any hardship is better than pretending to do what one is
paid for, and never really doing it.  Everything here I can do as well
as any one else could; perhaps better than some—Rosy, for example.
Though she is just the sort of beautiful creature that is imprisoned
with ogres in fairy tales.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F"><emph rend="italics">Rosy!</emph></said> cried Fred, in a tone of profound brotherly scepticism.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Come, Fred!</said> said Mary, emphatically; <said who="#M">you have no right to be so
critical.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Do you mean anything particular—just now?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">No, I mean something general—always.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Oh, that I am idle and extravagant.  Well, I am not fit to be a poor
man.  I should not have made a bad fellow if I had been rich.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">You would have done your duty in that state of life to which it has
not pleased God to call you,</said> said Mary, laughing.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Well, I couldn't do my duty as a clergyman, any more than you could do
yours as a governess.  You ought to have a little fellow-feeling there,
Mary.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">I never said you ought to be a clergyman.  There are other sorts of
work.  It seems to me very miserable not to resolve on some course and
act accordingly.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">So I could, if—</said> Fred broke off, and stood up, leaning against the
mantel-piece.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">If you were sure you should not have a fortune?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">I did not say that.  You want to quarrel with me.  It is too bad of
you to be guided by what other people say about me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">How can I want to quarrel with you?  I should be quarrelling with all
my new books,</said> said Mary, lifting the volume on the table.  <said who="#M">However
naughty you may be to other people, you are good to me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Because I like you better than any one else.  But I know you despise
me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Yes, I do—a little,</said> said Mary, nodding, with a smile.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">You would admire a stupendous fellow, who would have wise opinions
about everything.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Yes, I should.</said> <said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false">  Mary was sewing swiftly, and seemed provokingly
mistress of the situation.  When a conversation has taken a wrong turn
for us, we only get farther and farther into the swamp of awkwardness.
This was what Fred Vincy felt. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">I suppose a woman is never in love with any one she has always
known—ever since she can remember; as a man often is.  It is always
some new fellow who strikes a girl.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Let me see,</said> said Mary, the corners of her mouth curling archly; <said who="#M">I
must go back on my experience.  There is Juliet—she seems an example
of what you say.  But then Ophelia had probably known Hamlet a long
while; and Brenda Troil—she had known Mordaunt Merton ever since they
were children; but then he seems to have been an estimable young man;
and Minna was still more deeply in love with Cleveland, who was a
stranger.  Waverley was new to Flora MacIvor; but then she did not fall
in love with him.  And there are Olivia and Sophia Primrose, and
Corinne—they may be said to have fallen in love with new men.
Altogether, my experience is rather mixed.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mary looked up with some roguishness at Fred, and that look of hers was
very dear to him, though the eyes were nothing more than clear windows
where observation sat laughingly.  He was certainly an affectionate
fellow, and as he had grown from boy to man, he had grown in love with
his old playmate, notwithstanding that share in the higher education of
the country which had exalted his views of rank and income. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">When a man is not loved, it is no use for him to say that he could be
a better fellow—could do anything—I mean, if he were sure of being
loved in return.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Not of the least use in the world for him to say he <emph rend="italics">could</emph> be better.
Might, could, would—they are contemptible auxiliaries.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">I don't see how a man is to be good for much unless he has some one
woman to love him dearly.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">I think the goodness should come before he expects that.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">You know better, Mary.  Women don't love men for their goodness.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Perhaps not.  But if they love them, they never think them bad.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">It is hardly fair to say I am bad.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">I said nothing at all about you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">I never shall be good for anything, Mary, if you will not say that you
love me—if you will not promise to marry me—I mean, when I am able to
marry.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">If I did love you, I would not marry you: I would certainly not
promise ever to marry you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">I think that is quite wicked, Mary.  If you love me, you ought to
promise to marry me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">On the contrary, I think it would be wicked in me to marry you even if
I did love you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">You mean, just as I am, without any means of maintaining a wife.  Of
course: I am but three-and-twenty.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">In that last point you will alter.  But I am not so sure of any other
alteration.  My father says an idle man ought not to exist, much less,
be married.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Then I am to blow my brains out?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">No; on the whole I should think you would do better to pass your
examination.  I have heard Mr. Farebrother say it is disgracefully
easy.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">That is all very fine.  Anything is easy to him.  Not that cleverness
has anything to do with it.  I am ten times cleverer than many men who
pass.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Dear me!</said> said Mary, unable to repress her sarcasm; <said who="#M">that accounts for
the curates like Mr. Crowse.  Divide your cleverness by ten, and the
quotient—dear me!—is able to take a degree.  But that only shows you
are ten times more idle than the others.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Well, if I did pass, you would not want me to go into the Church?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">That is not the question—what I want you to do.  You have a
conscience of your own, I suppose.  There! there is Mr. Lydgate.  I
must go and tell my uncle.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Mary,</said> said Fred, seizing her hand as she rose; <said who="#F">if you will not give
me some encouragement, I shall get worse instead of better.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">I will not give you any encouragement,</said> said Mary, reddening.  <said who="#M">Your
friends would dislike it, and so would mine.  My father would think it
a disgrace to me if I accepted a man who got into debt, and would not
work!</said>
</P>

<P>
Fred was stung, and released her hand.  She walked to the door, but
there she turned and said: <said who="#M">Fred, you have always been so good, so
generous to me.  I am not ungrateful.  But never speak to me in that
way again.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Very well,</said> said Fred, sulkily, taking up his hat and whip.  His
complexion showed patches of pale pink and dead white. <said who="#F" direct="false" aloud="false">  Like many a
plucked idle young gentleman, he was thoroughly in love, and with a
plain girl, who had no money!  But having Mr. Featherstone's land in
the background, and a persuasion that, let Mary say what she would, she
really did care for him, Fred was not utterly in despair. </said>
</P>

<P>
When he got home, he gave four of the twenties to his mother, asking
her to keep them for him.  <said who="#F">I don't want to spend that money, mother.
I want it to pay a debt with.  So keep it safe away from my fingers.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrsV">Bless you, my dear,</said> said Mrs. Vincy. <said who="#MrsV" direct="false" aloud="false"> She doted on her eldest son and
her youngest girl (a child of six), whom others thought her two
naughtiest children.  The mother's eyes are not always deceived in
their partiality: she at least can best judge who is the tender,
filial-hearted child. And Fred was certainly very fond of his mother. </said>
Perhaps it was his fondness for another person also that made him
particularly anxious to take some security against his own liability to
spend the hundred pounds.  For the creditor to whom he owed a hundred
and sixty held a firmer security in the shape of a bill signed by
Mary's father.

<first> A great historian, as he insisted on calling himself, who had the
happiness to be dead a hundred and twenty years ago, and so to take his
place among the colossi whose huge legs our living pettiness is
observed to walk under, glories in his copious remarks and digressions
as the least imitable part of his work, and especially in those initial
chapters to the successive books of his history, where he seems to
bring his armchair to the proscenium and chat with us in all the lusty
ease of his fine English. </first> But Fielding lived when the days were longer
(for time, like money, is measured by our needs), when summer
afternoons were spacious, and the clock ticked slowly in the winter
evenings. <first>  We belated historians must not linger after his example; and
if we did so, it is probable that our chat would be thin and eager, as
if delivered from a campstool in a parrot-house. </first> <first> I at least have so
much to do in unraveling certain human lots, and seeing how they were
woven and interwoven, that all the light I can command must be
concentrated on this particular web, and not dispersed over that
tempting range of relevancies called the universe. </first>
</P>

<P>
<first> At present I have to make the new settler Lydgate better known to any
one interested in him than he could possibly be even to those who had
seen the most of him since his arrival in Middlemarch. </first> For surely all
must admit that a man may be puffed and belauded, envied, ridiculed,
counted upon as a tool and fallen in love with, or at least selected as
a future husband, and yet remain virtually unknown—known merely as a
cluster of signs for his neighbors' false suppositions. <said who="#MM" direct="false" aloud="false"> There was a
general impression, however, that Lydgate was not altogether a common
country doctor, and in Middlemarch at that time such an impression was
significant of great things being expected from him.  For everybody's
family doctor was remarkably clever, and was understood to have
immeasurable skill in the management and training of the most skittish
or vicious diseases.  The evidence of his cleverness was of the higher
intuitive order, lying in his lady-patients' immovable conviction, and
was unassailable by any objection except that their intuitions were
opposed by others equally strong; each lady who saw medical truth in
Wrench and <said>the strengthening treatment</said> regarding Toller and <said>the
lowering system</said> as medical perdition. </said> For the heroic times of copious
bleeding and blistering had not yet departed, still less the times of
thorough-going theory, when disease in general was called by some bad
name, and treated accordingly without shilly-shally—as if, for
example, it were to be called insurrection, which must not be fired on
with blank-cartridge, but have its blood drawn at once. <said who="#MM" direct="false" aloud="false"> The
strengtheners and the lowerers were all <said>clever</said> men in somebody's
opinion, which is really as much as can be said for any living talents.
Nobody's imagination had gone so far as to conjecture that Mr. Lydgate
could know as much as Dr. Sprague and Dr. Minchin, the two physicians,
who alone could offer any hope when danger was extreme, and when the
smallest hope was worth a guinea. <first> Still, I repeat, there was a general
impression that Lydgate was something rather more uncommon than any
general practitioner in Middlemarch. </first> And this was true.  He was but
seven-and-twenty, an age at which many men are not quite common—at
which they are hopeful of achievement, resolute in avoidance, thinking
that Mammon shall never put a bit in their mouths and get astride their
backs, but rather that Mammon, if they have anything to do with him,
shall draw their chariot. </said>
</P>

<P>
He had been left an orphan when he was fresh from a public school.  His
father, a military man, had made but little provision for three
children, and when the boy Tertius asked to have a medical education,
it seemed easier to his guardians to grant his request by apprenticing
him to a country practitioner than to make any objections on the score
of family dignity.  He was one of the rarer lads who early get a
decided bent and make up their minds that there is something particular
in life which they would like to do for its own sake, and not because
their fathers did it. <first> Most of us who turn to any subject with love
remember some morning or evening hour when we got on a high stool to
reach down an untried volume, or sat with parted lips listening to a
new talker, or for very lack of books began to listen to the voices
within, as the first traceable beginning of our love. </first> Something of
that sort happened to Lydgate.  He was a quick fellow, and when hot
from play, would toss himself in a corner, and in five minutes be deep
in any sort of book that he could lay his hands on: if it were Rasselas
or Gulliver, so much the better, but Bailey's Dictionary would do, or
the Bible with the Apocrypha in it.  Something he must read, when he
was not riding the pony, or running and hunting, or listening to the
talk of men.  All this was true of him at ten years of age; he had then
read through <said>Chrysal, or the Adventures of a Guinea,</said> which was
neither milk for babes, nor any chalky mixture meant to pass for milk,
and it had already occurred to him that books were stuff, and that life
was stupid.  His school studies had not much modified that opinion, for
though he <said>did</said> his classics and mathematics, he was not pre-eminent in
them.  It was said of him, that Lydgate could do anything he liked, but
he had certainly not yet liked to do anything remarkable.  He was a
vigorous animal with a ready understanding, but no spark had yet
kindled in him an intellectual passion; knowledge seemed to him a very
superficial affair, easily mastered: judging from the conversation of
his elders, he had apparently got already more than was necessary for
mature life.  Probably this was not an exceptional result of expensive
teaching at that period of short-waisted coats, and other fashions
which have not yet recurred. <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> But, one vacation, a wet day sent him to
the small home library to hunt once more for a book which might have
some freshness for him: in vain! unless, indeed, he took down a dusty
row of volumes with gray-paper backs and dingy labels—the volumes of
an old Cyclopaedia which he had never disturbed.  It would at least be
a novelty to disturb them. </said> They were on the highest shelf, and he
stood on a chair to get them down.  But he opened the volume which he
first took from the shelf: somehow, one is apt to read in a makeshift
attitude, just where it might seem inconvenient to do so.  The page he
opened on was under the head of Anatomy, and the first passage that
drew his eyes was on the valves of the heart. <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> He was not much
acquainted with valves of any sort, but he knew that valvae were
folding-doors, and through this crevice came a sudden light startling
him with his first vivid notion of finely adjusted mechanism in the
human frame. A liberal education had of course left him free to read
the indecent passages in the school classics, but beyond a general
sense of secrecy and obscenity in connection with his internal
structure, had left his imagination quite unbiassed, so that for
anything he knew his brains lay in small bags at his temples, and he
had no more thought of representing to himself how his blood circulated
than how paper served instead of gold.  But the moment of vocation had
come, and before he got down from his chair, the world was made new to
him by a presentiment of endless processes filling the vast spaces
planked out of his sight by that wordy ignorance which he had supposed
to be knowledge.  From that hour Lydgate felt the growth of an
intellectual passion. </said>
</P>

<P>
<first> We are not afraid of telling over and over again how a man comes to
fall in love with a woman and be wedded to her, or else be fatally
parted from her. </first> <first> Is it due to excess of poetry or of stupidity that we
are never weary of describing what King James called a woman's <said>makdom
and her fairnesse,</said> never weary of listening to the twanging of the old
Troubadour strings, and are comparatively uninterested in that other
kind of <said>makdom and fairnesse</said> which must be wooed with industrious
thought and patient renunciation of small desires?</first> In the story of
this passion, too, the development varies: sometimes it is the glorious
marriage, sometimes frustration and final parting.  And not seldom the
catastrophe is bound up with the other passion, sung by the
Troubadours.  For in the multitude of middle-aged men who go about
their vocations in a daily course determined for them much in the same
way as the tie of their cravats, there is always a good number who once
meant to shape their own deeds and alter the world a little.  The story
of their coming to be shapen after the average and fit to be packed by
the gross, is hardly ever told even in their consciousness; for perhaps
their ardor in generous unpaid toil cooled as imperceptibly as the
ardor of other youthful loves, till one day their earlier self walked
like a ghost in its old home and made the new furniture ghastly.
Nothing in the world more subtle than the process of their gradual
change! <first> In the beginning they inhaled it unknowingly: you and I may
have sent some of our breath towards infecting them, when we uttered
our conforming falsities or drew our silly conclusions: or perhaps it
came with the vibrations from a woman's glance.</first>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> Lydgate did not mean to be one of those failures, and there was the
better hope of him because his scientific interest soon took the form
of a professional enthusiasm: he had a youthful belief in his
bread-winning work, not to be stifled by that initiation in makeshift
called his 'prentice days; and he carried to his studies in London,
Edinburgh, and Paris, the conviction that the medical profession as it
might be was the finest in the world; presenting the most perfect
interchange between science and art; offering the most direct alliance
between intellectual conquest and the social good.  Lydgate's nature
demanded this combination: he was an emotional creature, with a
flesh-and-blood sense of fellowship which withstood all the
abstractions of special study.  He cared not only for "cases", but for
John and Elizabeth, especially Elizabeth. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> There was another attraction in his profession: it wanted reform, and
gave a man an opportunity for some indignant resolve to reject its
venal decorations and other humbug, and to be the possessor of genuine
though undemanded qualifications. </said> He went to study in Paris with the
determination that when he came home again he would settle in some
provincial town as a general practitioner, and resist the
irrational severance between medical and surgical knowledge in the
interest of his own scientific pursuits, as well as of the general
advance: he would keep away from the range of London intrigues,
jealousies, and social truckling, and win celebrity, however slowly, as
Jenner had done, by the independent value of his work.  For it must be
remembered that this was a dark period; and in spite of venerable
colleges which used great efforts to secure purity of knowledge by
making it scarce, and to exclude error by a rigid exclusiveness in
relation to fees and appointments, it happened that very ignorant young
gentlemen were promoted in town, and many more got a legal right to
practise over large areas in the country.  Also, the high standard held
up to the public mind by the College of Physicians, which gave its peculiar
sanction to the expensive and highly rarefied medical instruction
obtained by graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, did not hinder quackery
from having an excellent time of it; for since professional practice
chiefly consisted in giving a great many drugs, the public inferred
that it might be better off with more drugs still, if they could only
be got cheaply, and hence swallowed large cubic measures of physic
prescribed by unscrupulous ignorance which had taken no degrees.
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> Considering that statistics had not yet embraced a calculation as to
the number of ignorant or canting doctors which absolutely must exist
in the teeth of all changes, it seemed to Lydgate that a change in the
units was the most direct mode of changing the numbers.  He meant to be
a unit who would make a certain amount of difference towards that
spreading change which would one day tell appreciably upon the
averages, and in the mean time have the pleasure of making an
advantageous difference to the viscera of his own patients.  But he did
not simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common.  He
was ambitious of a wider effect: he was fired with the possibility that
he might work out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link
in the chain of discovery. </said>
</P>

<P>
<second> Does it seem incongruous to you that a Middlemarch surgeon should dream
of himself as a discoverer? </second> <first> Most of us, indeed, know little of the
great originators until they have been lifted up among the
constellations and already rule our fates. </first> But that Herschel, for
example, who <said>broke the barriers of the heavens</said>—did he not once play
a provincial church-organ, and give music-lessons to stumbling
pianists?  Each of those Shining Ones had to walk on the earth among
neighbors who perhaps thought much more of his gait and his garments
than of anything which was to give him a title to everlasting fame:
each of them had his little local personal history sprinkled with small
temptations and sordid cares, which made the retarding friction of his
course towards final companionship with the immortals. <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> Lydgate was not
blind to the dangers of such friction, but he had plenty of confidence
in his resolution to avoid it as far as possible: being
seven-and-twenty, he felt himself experienced.  And he was not going to
have his vanities provoked by contact with the showy worldly successes
of the capital, but to live among people who could hold no rivalry with
that pursuit of a great idea which was to be a twin object with the
assiduous practice of his profession.  There was fascination in the
hope that the two purposes would illuminate each other: the careful
observation and inference which was his daily work, the use of the lens
to further his judgment in special cases, would further his thought as
an instrument of larger inquiry.  Was not this the typical pre-eminence
of his profession?  He would be a good Middlemarch doctor, and by that
very means keep himself in the track of far-reaching investigation.  On
one point he may fairly claim approval at this particular stage of his
career: he did not mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make
a profit out of poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are
exposing adulteration, or hold shares in a gambling-hell that they may
have leisure to represent the cause of public morality.  He intended to
begin in his own case some particular reforms which were quite
certainly within his reach, and much less of a problem than the
demonstrating of an anatomical conception.  One of these reforms was to
act stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision, and simply
prescribe, without dispensing drugs or taking percentage from
druggists.  This was an innovation for one who had chosen to adopt the
style of general practitioner in a country town, and would be felt as
offensive criticism by his professional brethren.  But Lydgate meant to
innovate in his treatment also, and he was wise enough to see that the
best security for his practising honestly according to his belief was
to get rid of systematic temptations to the contrary. </said>
</P>

<P>
<first> Perhaps that was a more cheerful time for observers and theorizers than
the present; we are apt to think it the finest era of the world when
America was beginning to be discovered, when a bold sailor, even if he
were wrecked, might alight on a new kingdom; and about 1829 the dark
territories of Pathology were a fine America for a spirited young
adventurer. </first> Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards
enlarging the scientific, rational basis of his profession.  The more
he became interested in special questions of disease, such as the
nature of fever or fevers, the more keenly he felt the need for that
fundamental knowledge of structure which just at the beginning of the
century had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of
Bichat, who died when he was only one-and-thirty, but, like another
Alexander, left a realm large enough for many heirs.  That great
Frenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies,
fundamentally considered, are not associations of organs which can be
understood by studying them first apart, and then as it were federally;
but must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues,
out of which the various organs—brain, heart, lungs, and so on—are
compacted, as the various accommodations of a house are built up in
various proportions of wood, iron, stone, brick, zinc, and the rest,
each material having its peculiar composition and proportions.  No man,
one sees, can understand and estimate the entire structure or its
parts—what are its frailties and what its repairs, without knowing the
nature of the materials.  And the conception wrought out by Bichat,
with his detailed study of the different tissues, acted necessarily on
medical questions as the turning of gas-light would act on a dim,
oil-lit street, showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of
structure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms
of maladies and the action of medicaments.  But results which depend on
human conscience and intelligence work slowly, and now at the end of
1829, most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the
old paths, and there was still scientific work to be done which might
have seemed to be a direct sequence of Bichat's. This great seer did
not go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the
living organism, marking the limit of anatomical analysis; but it was
open to another mind to say, have not these structures some common
basis from which they have all started, as your sarsnet, gauze, net,
satin, and velvet from the raw cocoon?  Here would be another light, as
of oxy-hydrogen, showing the very grain of things, and revising all
former explanations.  Of this sequence to Bichat's work, already
vibrating along many currents of the European mind, Lydgate was
enamoured; he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of
living structure, and help to define men's thought more accurately
after the true order.  The work had not yet been done, but only
prepared for those who knew how to use the preparation. <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> What was the
primitive tissue?  In that way Lydgate put the question—not quite in
the way required by the awaiting answer; but such missing of the right
word befalls many seekers. </FI> And he counted on quiet intervals to be
watchfully seized, for taking up the threads of investigation—on many
hints to be won from diligent application, not only of the scalpel, but
of the microscope, which research had begun to use again with new
enthusiasm of reliance.  Such was Lydgate's plan of his future: to do
good small work for Middlemarch, and great work for the world.
</P>

<P>
He was certainly a happy fellow at this time: to be seven-and-twenty,
without any fixed vices, with a generous resolution that his action
should be beneficent, and with ideas in his brain that made life
interesting quite apart from the cultus of horseflesh and other mystic
rites of costly observance, which the eight hundred pounds left him
after buying his practice would certainly not have gone far in paying
for.  He was at a starting-point which makes many a man's career a fine
subject for betting, if there were any gentlemen given to that
amusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an
arduous purpose, with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of
circumstance, all the niceties of inward balance, by which a man swims
and makes his point or else is carried headlong.  The risk would remain
even with close knowledge of Lydgate's character; for character too is
a process and an unfolding.  The man was still in the making, as much
as the Middlemarch doctor and immortal discoverer, and there were both
virtues and faults capable of shrinking or expanding. <first> The faults will
not, I hope, be a reason for the withdrawal of your interest in him.
Among our valued friends is there not some one or other who is a little
too self-confident and disdainful; whose distinguished mind is a little
spotted with commonness; who is a little pinched here and protuberant
there with native prejudices; or whose better energies are liable to
lapse down the wrong channel under the influence of transient
solicitations? </first> All these things might be alleged against Lydgate, but
then, they are the periphrases of a polite preacher, who talks of Adam,
and would not like to mention anything painful to the pew-renters.  The
particular faults from which these delicate generalities are distilled
have distinguishable physiognomies, diction, accent, and grimaces;
filling up parts in very various dramas. <first> Our vanities differ as our
noses do: all conceit is not the same conceit, but varies in
correspondence with the minutiae of mental make in which one of us
differs from another. </first> Lydgate's conceit was of the arrogant sort,
never simpering, never impertinent, but massive in its claims and
benevolently contemptuous.  He would do a great deal for noodles, being
sorry for them, and feeling quite sure that they could have no power
over him: he had thought of joining the Saint Simonians when he was in
Paris, in order to turn them against some of their own doctrines.  All
his faults were marked by kindred traits, and were those of a man who
had a fine baritone, whose clothes hung well upon him, and who even in
his ordinary gestures had an air of inbred distinction. <said who="#younglady" direct="false" aloud="false"> Where then lay
the spots of commonness? says a young lady enamoured of that careless
grace.  How could there be any commonness in a man so well-bred, so
ambitious of social distinction, so generous and unusual in his views
of social duty? </said> <second> As easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius
if you take him unawares on the wrong subject, or as many a man who has
the best will to advance the social millennium might be ill-inspired in
imagining its lighter pleasures; unable to go beyond Offenbach's music,
or the brilliant punning in the last burlesque. </second> Lydgate's spots of
commonness lay in the complexion of his prejudices, which, in spite of
noble intention and sympathy, were half of them such as are found in
ordinary men of the world: that distinction of mind which belonged to
his intellectual ardor, did not penetrate his feeling and judgment
about furniture, or women, or the desirability of its being known
(without his telling) that he was better born than other country
surgeons.  He did not mean to think of furniture at present; but
whenever he did so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes
of reform would lift him above the vulgarity of feeling that there
would be an incompatibility in his furniture not being of the best.
</P>

<P>
As to women, he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous
folly, which he meant to be final, since marriage at some distant
period would of course not be impetuous.  For those who want to be
acquainted with Lydgate it will be good to know what was that case of
impetuous folly, for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving
of passion to which he was prone, together with the chivalrous kindness
which helped to make him morally lovable.  The story can be told
without many words.  It happened when he was studying in Paris, and
just at the time when, over and above his other work, he was occupied
with some galvanic experiments.  One evening, tired with his
experimenting, and not being able to elicit the facts he needed, he
left his frogs and rabbits to some repose under their trying and
mysterious dispensation of unexplained shocks, and went to finish his
evening at the theatre of the Porte Saint Martin, where there was a
melodrama which he had already seen several times; attracted, not by
the ingenious work of the collaborating authors, but by an actress
whose part it was to stab her lover, mistaking him for the
evil-designing duke of the piece.  Lydgate was in love with this
actress, as a man is in love with a woman whom he never expects to
speak to.  She was a Provencale, with dark eyes, a Greek profile, and
rounded majestic form, having that sort of beauty which carries a sweet
matronliness even in youth, and her voice was a soft cooing.  She had
but lately come to Paris, and bore a virtuous reputation, her husband
acting with her as the unfortunate lover.  It was her acting which was
"no better than it should be," but the public was satisfied.  Lydgate's
only relaxation now was to go and look at this woman, just as he might
have thrown himself under the breath of the sweet south on a bank of
violets for a while, without prejudice to his galvanism, to which he
would presently return.  But this evening the old drama had a new
catastrophe.  At the moment when the heroine was to act the stabbing of
her lover, and he was to fall gracefully, the wife veritably stabbed
her husband, who fell as death willed.  A wild shriek pierced the
house, and the Provencale fell swooning: a shriek and a swoon were
demanded by the play, but the swooning too was real this time.  Lydgate
leaped and climbed, he hardly knew how, on to the stage, and was active
in help, making the acquaintance of his heroine by finding a contusion
on her head and lifting her gently in his arms.  Paris rang with the
story of this death:—was it a murder?  Some of the actress's warmest
admirers were inclined to believe in her guilt, and liked her the
better for it (such was the taste of those times); but Lydgate was not
one of these.  He vehemently contended for her innocence, and the
remote impersonal passion for her beauty which he had felt before, had
passed now into personal devotion, and tender thought of her lot.  The
notion of murder was absurd: no motive was discoverable, the young
couple being understood to dote on each other; and it was not
unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should have brought
these grave consequences.  The legal investigation ended in Madame
Laure's release.  Lydgate by this time had had many interviews with
her, and found her more and more adorable.  She talked little; but that
was an additional charm.  She was melancholy, and seemed grateful; her
presence was enough, like that of the evening light.  Lydgate was madly
anxious about her affection, and jealous lest any other man than
himself should win it and ask her to marry him.  But instead of
reopening her engagement at the Porte Saint Martin, where she would
have been all the more popular for the fatal episode, she left Paris
without warning, forsaking her little court of admirers.  Perhaps no
one carried inquiry far except Lydgate, who felt that all science had
come to a stand-still while he imagined the unhappy Laure, stricken by
ever-wandering sorrow, herself wandering, and finding no faithful
comforter.  Hidden actresses, however, are not so difficult to find as
some other hidden facts, and it was not long before Lydgate gathered
indications that Laure had taken the route to Lyons.  He found her at
last acting with great success at Avignon under the same name, looking
more majestic than ever as a forsaken wife carrying her child in her
arms. <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false">  He spoke to her after the play, was received with the usual
quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water, and
obtained leave to visit her the next day; when he was bent on telling
her that he adored her, and on asking her to marry him.  He knew that
this was like the sudden impulse of a madman—incongruous even with his
habitual foibles.  No matter!  It was the one thing which he was
resolved to do. </said> He had two selves within him apparently, and they must
learn to accommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments.
<first> Strange, that some of us, with quick alternate vision, see beyond our
infatuations, and even while we rave on the heights, behold the wide
plain where our persistent self pauses and awaits us. </first>
</P>

<P>
To have approached Laure with any suit that was not reverentially
tender would have been simply a contradiction of his whole feeling
towards her.
</P>

<P>
<said>You have come all the way from Paris to find me?</said> she said to him the
next day, sitting before him with folded arms, and looking at him with
eyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating animal wonders.
<said>Are all Englishmen like that?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I came because I could not live without trying to see you.  You are
lonely; I love you; I want you to consent to be my wife; I will wait,
but I want you to promise that you will marry me—no one else.</said>
</P>

<P>
Laure looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from under
her grand eyelids, until he was full of rapturous certainty, and knelt
close to her knees.
</P>

<P>
<said>I will tell you something,</said> she said, in her cooing way, keeping her
arms folded.  <said>My foot really slipped.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">I know, I know,</said> said Lydgate, deprecatingly.  <said who="#M">It was a fatal
accident—a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the more.</said>
</P>

<P>
Again Laure paused a little and then said, slowly, <said><emph rend="italics">I meant to do it.</emph></said>
</P>

<P>
Lydgate, strong man as he was, turned pale and trembled: moments seemed
to pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">There was a secret, then,</said> he said at last, even vehemently.  <said who="#M">He was
brutal to you: you hated him.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said>No! he wearied me; he was too fond: he would live in Paris, and not in
my country; that was not agreeable to me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#M">Great God!</said> said Lydgate, in a groan of horror.  <said who="#M">And you planned to
murder him?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said>I did not plan: it came to me in the play—<emph rend="italics">I meant to do it.</emph></said>
</P>

<P>
Lydgate stood mute, and unconsciously pressed his hat on while he
looked at her.  He saw this woman—the first to whom he had given his
young adoration—amid the throng of stupid criminals.
</P>

<P>
<said>You are a good young man,</said> she said.  <said>But I do not like husbands.  I
will never have another.</said>
</P>

<P>
Three days afterwards Lydgate was at his galvanism again in his Paris
chambers, believing that illusions were at an end for him.  He was
saved from hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his heart and
his belief that human life might be made better.  But he had more
reason than ever for trusting his judgment, now that it was so
experienced; and henceforth he would take a strictly scientific view of
woman, entertaining no expectations but such as were justified
beforehand.
</P>

<P>
No one in Middlemarch was likely to have such a notion of Lydgate's
past as has here been faintly shadowed, and indeed the respectable
townsfolk there were not more given than mortals generally to any eager
attempt at exactness in the representation to themselves of what did
not come under their own senses.  Not only young virgins of that town,
but gray-bearded men also, were often in haste to conjecture how a new
acquaintance might be wrought into their purposes, contented with very
vague knowledge as to the way in which life had been shaping him for
that instrumentality.  Middlemarch, in fact, counted on swallowing
Lydgate and assimilating him very comfortably.

<P>
The question whether Mr. Tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain
to the hospital was an exciting topic to the Middlemarchers; and
Lydgate heard it discussed in a way that threw much light on the power
exercised in the town by Mr. Bulstrode.  The banker was evidently a
ruler, but there was an opposition party, and even among his supporters
there were some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a
compromise, and who frankly stated their impression that the general
scheme of things, and especially the casualties of trade, required you
to hold a candle to the devil.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Bulstrode's power was not due simply to his being a country banker,
who knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could
touch the springs of their credit; it was fortified by a beneficence
that was at once ready and severe—ready to confer obligations, and
severe in watching the result.  He had gathered, as an industrious man
always at his post, a chief share in administering the town charities,
and his private charities were both minute and abundant.  He would take
a great deal of pains about apprenticing Tegg the shoemaker's son, and
he would watch over Tegg's church-going; he would defend Mrs. Strype
the washerwoman against Stubbs's unjust exaction on the score of her
drying-ground, and he would himself scrutinize a calumny against Mrs.
Strype.  His private minor loans were numerous, but he would inquire
strictly into the circumstances both before and after.  In this way a
man gathers a domain in his neighbors' hope and fear as well as
gratitude; and power, when once it has got into that subtle region,
propagates itself, spreading out of all proportion to its external
means.  It was a principle with Mr. Bulstrode to gain as much power as
possible, that he might use it for the glory of God.  He went through a
great deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust
his motives, and make clear to himself what God's glory required. <first> But,
as we have seen, his motives were not always rightly appreciated. </first>
There were many crass minds in Middlemarch whose reflective scales
could only weigh things in the lump; and they had a strong suspicion
that since Mr. Bulstrode could not enjoy life in their fashion, eating
and drinking so little as he did, and worreting himself about
everything, he must have a sort of vampire's feast in the sense of
mastery.
</P>

<P>
The subject of the chaplaincy came up at Mr. Vincy's table when Lydgate
was dining there, and the family connection with Mr. Bulstrode did not,

<said who="#Chichely">What line shall you take, then?</said> said Mr. Chichely, the coroner, a

<said who="#MrV">Oh, I'm precious glad I'm not one of the Directors now.  I shall vote
for referring the matter to the Directors and the Medical Board

physician of the town, and then at Lydgate who sat opposite.  <said who="#MrV">You
medical gentlemen must consult which sort of black draught you will

</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I know little of either,</said> said Lydgate; <said who="#Lyd">but in general, appointments
are apt to be made too much a question of personal liking.  The fittest

put them out of the question.</said>

<P>
Dr. Sprague, who was considered the physician of most <said>weight,</said> though
Dr. Minchin was usually said to have more <said>penetration,</said> divested his
large heavy face of all expression, and looked at his wine-glass while
Lydgate was speaking. <said who="#Sprague" direct="false" aloud="false"> Whatever was not problematical and suspected

Meningitis, of which at least one copy marked <said>own</said> was bound in calf. </said>

self-satisfaction is an untaxed kind of property which it is very
unpleasant to find deprecated. </first>

Lydgate's remark, however, did not meet the sense of the company.  Mr.

profession: your words appear to point that way.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Sprague">I disapprove of Wakley,</said> interposed Dr. Sprague, <said who="#Sprague">no man more: he is
an ill-intentioned fellow, who would sacrifice the respectability of
the profession, which everybody knows depends on the London Colleges,
for the sake of getting some notoriety for himself.  There are men who
don't mind about being kicked blue if they can only get talked about.
But Wakley is right sometimes,</said> the Doctor added, judicially.  <said who="#Sprague">I could
mention one or two points in which Wakley is in the right.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Chichely">Oh, well,</said> said Mr. Chichely, <said who="#Chichely">I blame no man for standing up in favor
of his own cloth; but, coming to argument, I should like to know how a
coroner is to judge of evidence if he has not had a legal training?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">In my opinion,</said> said Lydgate, <said who="#Lyd">legal training only makes a man more
incompetent in questions that require knowledge of another kind.
People talk about evidence as if it could really be weighed in scales
by a blind Justice.  No man can judge what is good evidence on any
particular subject, unless he knows that subject well.  A lawyer is no
better than an old woman at a post-mortem examination.  How is he to
know the action of a poison?  You might as well say that scanning verse
will teach you to scan the potato crops.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said>You are aware, I suppose, that it is not the coroner's business to
conduct the <i>post-mortem</i>, but only to take the evidence of the medical
witness?</said> said Mr. Chichely, with some scorn.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Who is often almost as ignorant as the coroner himself,</said> said Lydgate.
<said who="#Lyd">Questions of medical jurisprudence ought not to be left to the chance
of decent knowledge in a medical witness, and the coroner ought not to
be a man who will believe that strychnine will destroy the coats of the
stomach if an ignorant practitioner happens to tell him so.</said>
</P>

<P>
Lydgate had really lost sight of the fact that Mr. Chichely was his
Majesty's coroner, and ended innocently with the question, <said who="#Lyd">Don't you
agree with me, Dr. Sprague?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Sprague">To a certain extent—with regard to populous districts, and in the
metropolis,</said> said the Doctor.  <said who="#Sprague">But I hope it will be long before this
part of the country loses the services of my friend Chichely, even
though it might get the best man in our profession to succeed him.  I
am sure Vincy will agree with me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrV">Yes, yes, give me a coroner who is a good coursing man,</said> said Mr.
Vincy, jovially.  <said who="#MrV">And in my opinion, you're safest with a lawyer.
Nobody can know everything. Most things are 'visitation of God.' And as
to poisoning, why, what you want to know is the law. Come, shall we
join the ladies?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> Lydgate's private opinion was that Mr. Chichely might be the very
coroner without bias as to the coats of the stomach, but he had not
meant to be personal.  This was one of the difficulties of moving in
good Middlemarch society: it was dangerous to insist on knowledge as a
qualification for any salaried office. </said> Fred Vincy had called Lydgate a
prig, and now Mr. Chichely was inclined to call him prick-eared;
especially when, in the drawing-room, he seemed to be making himself
eminently agreeable to Rosamond, whom he had easily monopolized in a
<i>tete-a-tete</i>, since Mrs. Vincy herself sat at the tea-table. She
resigned no domestic function to her daughter; and the matron's
blooming good-natured face, with the two volatile pink strings floating
from her fine throat, and her cheery manners to husband and children,
was certainly among the great attractions of the Vincy
house—attractions which made it all the easier to fall in love with
the daughter.  The tinge of unpretentious, inoffensive vulgarity in
Mrs. Vincy gave more effect to Rosamond's refinement, which was beyond
what Lydgate had expected.
</P>

<P>
Certainly, small feet and perfectly turned shoulders aid the impression
of refined manners, and the right thing said seems quite astonishingly
right when it is accompanied with exquisite curves of lip and eyelid.
And Rosamond could say the right thing; for she was clever with that
sort of cleverness which catches every tone except the humorous.
Happily she never attempted to joke, and this perhaps was the most
decisive mark of her cleverness.
</P>

<P>
She and Lydgate readily got into conversation. <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> He regretted that he
had not heard her sing the other day at Stone Court.  The only pleasure
he allowed himself during the latter part of his stay in Paris was to
go and hear music. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">You have studied music, probably?</said> said Rosamond.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">No, I know the notes of many birds, and I know many melodies by ear;
but the music that I don't know at all, and have no notion about,
delights me—affects me.  How stupid the world is that it does not make
more use of such a pleasure within its reach!</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Yes, and you will find Middlemarch very tuneless.  There are hardly
any good musicians.  I only know two gentlemen who sing at all well.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I suppose it is the fashion to sing comic songs in a rhythmic way,
leaving you to fancy the tune—very much as if it were tapped on a
drum?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Ah, you have heard Mr. Bowyer,</said> said Rosamond, with one of her rare
smiles.  <said who="#R">But we are speaking very ill of our neighbors.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> Lydgate was almost forgetting that he must carry on the conversation,
in thinking how lovely this creature was, her garment seeming to be
made out of the faintest blue sky, herself so immaculately blond, as if
the petals of some gigantic flower had just opened and disclosed her;
and yet with this infantine blondness showing so much ready,
self-possessed grace.  Since he had had the memory of Laure, Lydgate
had lost all taste for large-eyed silence: the divine cow no longer
attracted him, and Rosamond was her very opposite. </said> But he recalled
himself.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">You will let me hear some music to-night, I hope.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">I will let you hear my attempts, if you like,</said> said Rosamond.  <said who="#R">Papa
is sure to insist on my singing.  But I shall tremble before you, who
have heard the best singers in Paris.  I have heard very little: I have
only once been to London.  But our organist at St. Peter's is a good
musician, and I go on studying with him.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Tell me what you saw in London.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Very little.</said>  (A more naive girl would have said, <said>Oh, everything!</said>
But Rosamond knew better.) <said who="#R"> A few of the ordinary sights, such as raw
country girls are always taken to.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Do you call yourself a raw country girl?</said> said Lydgate, looking at her
with an involuntary emphasis of admiration, which made Rosamond blush
with pleasure.  But she remained simply serious, turned her long neck a
little, and put up her hand to touch her wondrous hair-plaits—an
habitual gesture with her as pretty as any movements of a kitten's paw.
Not that Rosamond was in the least like a kitten: she was a sylph
caught young and educated at Mrs. Lemon's.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">I assure you my mind is raw,</said> she said immediately; <said who="#R">I pass at
Middlemarch.  I am not afraid of talking to our old neighbors.  But I
am really afraid of you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">An accomplished woman almost always knows more than we men, though her
knowledge is of a different sort.  I am sure you could teach me a
thousand things—as an exquisite bird could teach a bear if there were
any common language between them.  Happily, there is a common language
between women and men, and so the bears can get taught.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Ah, there is Fred beginning to strum!  I must go and hinder him from
jarring all your nerves,</said> said Rosamond, moving to the other side of
the room, where Fred having opened the piano, at his father's desire,
that Rosamond might give them some music, was parenthetically
performing <said>Cherry Ripe!</said> with one hand.  Able men who have passed
their examinations will do these things sometimes, not less than the
plucked Fred.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Fred, pray defer your practising till to-morrow; you will make Mr.
Lydgate ill,</said> said Rosamond.  <said who="#R">He has an ear.</said>
</P>

<P>
Fred laughed, and went on with his tune to the end.
</P>

<P>
Rosamond turned to Lydgate, smiling gently, and said, <said who="#R">You perceive,
the bears will not always be taught.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#F">Now then, Rosy!</said> said Fred, springing from the stool and twisting it
upward for her, with a hearty expectation of enjoyment.  <said who="#F">Some good
rousing tunes first.</said>
</P>

<P>
Rosamond played admirably. <first> Her master at Mrs. Lemon's school (close to
a county town with a memorable history that had its relics in church
and castle) was one of those excellent musicians here and there to be
found in our provinces, worthy to compare with many a noted
Kapellmeister in a country which offers more plentiful conditions of
musical celebrity. </first> Rosamond, with the executant's instinct, had seized
his manner of playing, and gave forth his large rendering of noble
music with the precision of an echo.  It was almost startling, heard
for the first time.  A hidden soul seemed to be flowing forth from
Rosamond's fingers; and so indeed it was, since souls live on in
perpetual echoes, and to all fine expression there goes somewhere an
originating activity, if it be only that of an interpreter.  Lydgate
was taken possession of, and began to believe in her as something
exceptional.  After all, he thought, one need not be surprised to find
the rare conjunctions of nature under circumstances apparently
unfavorable: come where they may, they always depend on conditions that
are not obvious.  He sat looking at her, and did not rise to pay her
any compliments, leaving that to others, now that his admiration was
deepened.
</P>

<P>
Her singing was less remarkable, but also well trained, and sweet to
hear as a chime perfectly in tune.  It is true she sang <said>Meet me by
moonlight,</said> and <said>I've been roaming</said>; for mortals must share the
fashions of their time, and none but the ancients can be always
classical.  But Rosamond could also sing <said>Black-eyed Susan</said> with
effect, or Haydn's canzonets, or <said>Voi, che sapete,</said> or <said>Batti,
batti"—she only wanted to know what her audience liked.
</P>

<P>
Her father looked round at the company, delighting in their admiration.
Her mother sat, like a Niobe before her troubles, with her youngest
little girl on her lap, softly beating the child's hand up and down in
time to the music.  And Fred, notwithstanding his general scepticism
about Rosy, listened to her music with perfect allegiance, wishing he
could do the same thing on his flute. <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> It was the pleasantest family
party that Lydgate had seen since he came to Middlemarch.  The Vincys
had the readiness to enjoy, the rejection of all anxiety, and the
belief in life as a merry lot, which made a house exceptional in most
county towns at that time, when Evangelicalism had cast a certain
suspicion as of plague-infection over the few amusements which survived
in the provinces. </said> At the Vincys' there was always whist, and the
card-tables stood ready now, making some of the company secretly
impatient of the music.  Before it ceased Mr. Farebrother came in—a
handsome, broad-chested but otherwise small man, about forty, whose
black was very threadbare: the brilliancy was all in his quick gray
eyes.  He came like a pleasant change in the light, arresting little
Louisa with fatherly nonsense as she was being led out of the room by
Miss Morgan, greeting everybody with some special word, and seeming to
condense more talk into ten minutes than had been held all through the
evening.  He claimed from Lydgate the fulfilment of a promise to come
and see him.  <said who="#FB"> I can't let you off, you know, because I have some
beetles to show you.  We collectors feel an interest in every new man
till he has seen all we have to show him.</said>
</P>

<P>
But soon he swerved to the whist-table, rubbing his hands and saying,
<said who="#FB">Come now, let us be serious!  Mr. Lydgate? not play?  Ah! you are too
young and light for this kind of thing.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> Lydgate said to himself that the clergyman whose abilities were so
painful to Mr. Bulstrode, appeared to have found an agreeable resort in
this certainly not erudite household.  He could half understand it: the
good-humor, the good looks of elder and younger, and the provision for
passing the time without any labor of intelligence, might make the
house beguiling to people who had no particular use for their odd hours. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MrsV" direct="false" aloud="false"> Everything looked blooming and joyous except Miss Morgan, who was
brown, dull, and resigned, and altogether, as Mrs. Vincy often said,
just the sort of person for a governess. </said> <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> Lydgate did not mean to pay
many such visits himself.  They were a wretched waste of the evenings;
and now, when he had talked a little more to Rosamond, he meant to
excuse himself and go. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">You will not like us at Middlemarch, I feel sure,</said> she said, when the
whist-players were settled.  <said who="#R">We are very stupid, and you have been
used to something quite different.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I suppose all country towns are pretty much alike,</said> said Lydgate.
<said who="#Lyd">But I have noticed that one always believes one's own town to be more
stupid than any other.  I have made up my mind to take Middlemarch as
it comes, and shall be much obliged if the town will take me in the
same way.  I have certainly found some charms in it which are much
greater than I had expected.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">You mean the rides towards Tipton and Lowick; every one is pleased
with those,</said> said Rosamond, with simplicity.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">No, I mean something much nearer to me.</said>
</P>

<P>
Rosamond rose and reached her netting, and then said, <said who="#R">Do you care
about dancing at all?  I am not quite sure whether clever men ever
dance.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I would dance with you if you would allow me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#R">Oh!</said> said Rosamond, with a slight deprecatory laugh.  <said who="#R">I was only
going to say that we sometimes have dancing, and I wanted to know
whether you would feel insulted if you were asked to come.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Not on the condition I mentioned.</said>
</P>

<P>
After this chat Lydgate thought that he was going, but on moving
towards the whist-tables, he got interested in watching Mr.
Farebrother's play, which was masterly, and also his face, which was a
striking mixture of the shrewd and the mild.  At ten o'clock supper was
brought in (such were the customs of Middlemarch) and there was
punch-drinking; but Mr. Farebrother had only a glass of water. <said who="#MrF" direct="false" aloud="false"> He was
winning, but there seemed to be no reason why the renewal of rubbers
should end, and Lydgate at last took his leave. </said>
</P>

<P>
But as it was not eleven o'clock, he chose to walk in the brisk air
towards the tower of St. Botolph's, Mr. Farebrother's church, which
stood out dark, square, and massive against the starlight.  It was the
oldest church in Middlemarch; the living, however, was but a vicarage
worth barely four hundred a-year. Lydgate had heard that, and he
wondered now whether Mr. Farebrother cared about the money he won at
cards; thinking, <said who="#Lyd">He seems a very pleasant fellow, but Bulstrode may
have his good reasons.</said>  Many things would be easier to Lydgate if it
should turn out that Mr. Bulstrode was generally justifiable.  <said who="#Lyd">What is
his religious doctrine to me, if he carries some good notions along
with it?  One must use such brains as are to be found.</said>
</P>

<P>
<first> These were actually Lydgate's first meditations as he walked away from
Mr. Vincy's, and on this ground I fear that many ladies will consider
him hardly worthy of their attention. </first> He thought of Rosamond and her
music only in the second place; and though, when her turn came, he
dwelt on the image of her for the rest of his walk, he felt no
agitation, and had no sense that any new current had set into his life.
He could not marry yet; he wished not to marry for several years; and
therefore he was not ready to entertain the notion of being in love
with a girl whom he happened to admire. <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> He did admire Rosamond
exceedingly; but that madness which had once beset him about Laure was
not, he thought, likely to recur in relation to any other woman.
Certainly, if falling in love had been at all in question, it would
have been quite safe with a creature like this Miss Vincy, who had just
the kind of intelligence one would desire in a woman—polished,
refined, docile, lending itself to finish in all the delicacies of
life, and enshrined in a body which expressed this with a force of
demonstration that excluded the need for other evidence.  Lydgate felt
sure that if ever he married, his wife would have that feminine
radiance, that distinctive womanhood which must be classed with flowers
and music, that sort of beauty which by its very nature was virtuous,
being moulded only for pure and delicate joys. </said>
</P>

<P>
But since he did not mean to marry for the next five years—his more
pressing business was to look into Louis' new book on Fever, which he
was specially interested in, because he had known Louis in Paris, and
had followed many anatomical demonstrations in order to ascertain the
specific differences of typhus and typhoid.  He went home and read far
into the smallest hour, bringing a much more testing vision of details
and relations into this pathological study than he had ever thought it
necessary to apply to the complexities of love and marriage, these
being subjects on which he felt himself amply informed by literature,
and that traditional wisdom which is handed down in the genial
conversation of men.  Whereas Fever had obscure conditions, and gave
him that delightful labor of the imagination which is not mere
arbitrariness, but the exercise of disciplined power—combining and
constructing with the clearest eye for probabilities and the fullest
obedience to knowledge; and then, in yet more energetic alliance with
impartial Nature, standing aloof to invent tests by which to try its
own work.
</P>

<P>
Many men have been praised as vividly imaginative on the strength of
their profuseness in indifferent drawing or cheap narration:—reports
of very poor talk going on in distant orbs; or portraits of Lucifer
coming down on his bad errands as a large ugly man with bat's wings and
spurts of phosphorescence; or exaggerations of wantonness that seem to
reflect life in a diseased dream.  But these kinds of inspiration
Lydgate regarded as rather vulgar and vinous compared with the
imagination that reveals subtle actions inaccessible by any sort of
lens, but tracked in that outer darkness through long pathways of
necessary sequence by the inward light which is the last refinement of
Energy, capable of bathing even the ethereal atoms in its ideally
illuminated space.  He for his part had tossed away all cheap
inventions where ignorance finds itself able and at ease: he was
enamoured of that arduous invention which is the very eye of research,
provisionally framing its object and correcting it to more and more
exactness of relation; he wanted to pierce the obscurity of those
minute processes which prepare human misery and joy, those invisible
thoroughfares which are the first lurking-places of anguish, mania, and
crime, that delicate poise and transition which determine the growth of
happy or unhappy consciousness.
</P>

<P>
<first> As he threw down his book, stretched his legs towards the embers in the
grate, and clasped his hands at the back of his head, in that agreeable
afterglow of excitement when thought lapses from examination of a
specific object into a suffusive sense of its connections with all the
rest of our existence—seems, as it were, to throw itself on its back
after vigorous swimming and float with the repose of unexhausted
strength—Lydgate felt a triumphant delight in his studies, and
something like pity for those less lucky men who were not of his
profession. </first>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">If I had not taken that turn when I was a lad,</said> he thought, <said who="#Lyd">I might
have got into some stupid draught-horse work or other, and lived always
in blinkers.  I should never have been happy in any profession that did
not call forth the highest intellectual strain, and yet keep me in good
warm contact with my neighbors.  There is nothing like the medical
profession for that: one can have the exclusive scientific life that
touches the distance and befriend the old fogies in the parish too.  It
is rather harder for a clergyman: Farebrother seems to be an anomaly.</said>
</P>

<P>
This last thought brought back the Vincys and all the pictures of the
evening.  They floated in his mind agreeably enough, and as he took up
his bed-candle his lips were curled with that incipient smile which is
apt to accompany agreeable recollections.  He was an ardent fellow, but
at present his ardor was absorbed in love of his work and in the
ambition of making his life recognized as a factor in the better life
of mankind—like other heroes of science who had nothing but an obscure
country practice to begin with.
</P>

<P>
<first> Poor Lydgate! or shall I say, Poor Rosamond! </first> Each lived in a world of
which the other knew nothing.  It had not occurred to Lydgate that he
had been a subject of eager meditation to Rosamond, who had neither any
reason for throwing her marriage into distant perspective, nor any
pathological studies to divert her mind from that ruminating habit,
that inward repetition of looks, words, and phrases, which makes a
large part in the lives of most girls.  He had not meant to look at her
or speak to her with more than the inevitable amount of admiration and
compliment which a man must give to a beautiful girl; indeed, it seemed
to him that his enjoyment of her music had remained almost silent, for
he feared falling into the rudeness of telling her his great surprise
at her possession of such accomplishment.  But Rosamond had registered
every look and word, and estimated them as the opening incidents of a
preconceived romance—incidents which gather value from the foreseen
development and climax. <said who="#R" direct="false" aloud="false"> In Rosamond's romance it was not necessary to
imagine much about the inward life of the hero, or of his serious
business in the world: of course, he had a profession and was clever,
as well as sufficiently handsome; but the piquant fact about Lydgate
was his good birth, which distinguished him from all Middlemarch
admirers, and presented marriage as a prospect of rising in rank and
getting a little nearer to that celestial condition on earth in which
she would have nothing to do with vulgar people, and perhaps at last
associate with relatives quite equal to the county people who looked
down on the Middlemarchers. </said> It was part of Rosamond's cleverness to
discern very subtly the faintest aroma of rank, and once when she had
seen the Miss Brookes accompanying their uncle at the county assizes,
and seated among the aristocracy, she had envied them, notwithstanding
their plain dress.
</P>

<P>
<first> If you think it incredible that to imagine Lydgate as a man of family
could cause thrills of satisfaction which had anything to do with the
sense that she was in love with him, I will ask you to use your power
of comparison a little more effectively, and consider whether red cloth
and epaulets have never had an influence of that sort. </first> <first> Our passions do
not live apart in locked chambers, but, dressed in their small wardrobe
of notions, bring their provisions to a common table and mess together,
feeding out of the common store according to their appetite. </first>
</P>

<P>
Rosamond, in fact, was entirely occupied not exactly with Tertius
Lydgate as he was in himself, but with his relation to her; and it was
excusable in a girl who was accustomed to hear that all young men
might, could, would be, or actually were in love with her, to believe
at once that Lydgate could be no exception.  His looks and words meant
more to her than other men's, because she cared more for them: she
thought of them diligently, and diligently attended to that perfection
of appearance, behavior, sentiments, and all other elegancies, which
would find in Lydgate a more adequate admirer than she had yet been
conscious of.
</P>

<P>
For Rosamond, though she would never do anything that was disagreeable
to her, was industrious; and now more than ever she was active in
sketching her landscapes and market-carts and portraits of friends, in
practising her music, and in being from morning till night her own
standard of a perfect lady, having always an audience in her own
consciousness, with sometimes the not unwelcome addition of a more
variable external audience in the numerous visitors of the house.  She
found time also to read the best novels, and even the second best, and
she knew much poetry by heart.  Her favorite poem was <said>Lalla Rookh.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="MM" direct="false" aloud="false">The best girl in the world!  He will be a happy fellow who gets her!
was the sentiment of the elderly gentlemen who visited the Vincys; and
the rejected young men thought of trying again, as is the fashion in
country towns where the horizon is not thick with coming rivals. </said> <said who="#MrsPlymdale" direct="false" aloud="false"> But
Mrs. Plymdale thought that Rosamond had been educated to a ridiculous
pitch, for what was the use of accomplishments which would be all laid
aside as soon as she was married? </said> <said who="#MrsB" direct="false" aloud="false">While her aunt Bulstrode, who had a
sisterly faithfulness towards her brother's family, had two sincere
wishes for Rosamond—that she might show a more serious turn of mind,
and that she might meet with a husband whose wealth corresponded to her
habits. </said>

<P>
The Rev. Camden Farebrother, whom Lydgate went to see the next evening,
lived in an old parsonage, built of stone, venerable enough to match
the church which it looked out upon.  All the furniture too in the
house was old, but with another grade of age—that of Mr. Farebrother's
father and grandfather.  There were painted white chairs, with gilding
and wreaths on them, and some lingering red silk damask with slits in
it.  There were engraved portraits of Lord Chancellors and other
celebrated lawyers of the last century; and there were old pier-glasses
to reflect them, as well as the little satin-wood tables and the sofas
resembling a prolongation of uneasy chairs, all standing in relief
against the dark wainscot. This was the physiognomy of the drawing-room
into which Lydgate was shown; and there were three ladies to receive
him, who were also old-fashioned, and of a faded but genuine
respectability: Mrs. Farebrother, the Vicar's white-haired mother,
befrilled and kerchiefed with dainty cleanliness, upright, quick-eyed,
and still under seventy; Miss Noble, her sister, a tiny old lady of
meeker aspect, with frills and kerchief decidedly more worn and mended;
and Miss Winifred Farebrother, the Vicar's elder sister, well-looking
like himself, but nipped and subdued as single women are apt to be who
spend their lives in uninterrupted subjection to their elders.  Lydgate
had not expected to see so quaint a group: knowing simply that Mr.
Farebrother was a bachelor, he had thought of being ushered into a
snuggery where the chief furniture would probably be books and
collections of natural objects.  The Vicar himself seemed to wear
rather a changed aspect, as most men do when acquaintances made
elsewhere see them for the first time in their own homes; some indeed
showing like an actor of genial parts disadvantageously cast for the
curmudgeon in a new piece.  This was not the case with Mr. Farebrother:
he seemed a trifle milder and more silent, the chief talker being his
mother, while he only put in a good-humored moderating remark here and
there.  The old lady was evidently accustomed to tell her company what
they ought to think, and to regard no subject as quite safe without her
steering.  She was afforded leisure for this function by having all her
little wants attended to by Miss Winifred.  Meanwhile tiny Miss Noble
carried on her arm a small basket, into which she diverted a bit of
sugar, which she had first dropped in her saucer as if by mistake;
looking round furtively afterwards, and reverting to her teacup with a
small innocent noise as of a tiny timid quadruped. <second> Pray think no ill
of Miss Noble. </second> That basket held small savings from her more portable
food, destined for the children of her poor friends among whom she
trotted on fine mornings; fostering and petting all needy creatures
being so spontaneous a delight to her, that she regarded it much as if
it had been a pleasant vice that she was addicted to.  Perhaps she was
conscious of being tempted to steal from those who had much that she
might give to those who had nothing, and carried in her conscience the
guilt of that repressed desire.  One must be poor to know the luxury of
giving!
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Farebrother welcomed the guest with a lively formality and
precision. <said who="#MFB" direct="false" aloud="false"> She presently informed him that they were not often in want
of medical aid in that house.  She had brought up her children to wear
flannel and not to over-eat themselves, which last habit she considered
the chief reason why people needed doctors.  Lydgate pleaded for those
whose fathers and mothers had over-eaten themselves, but Mrs.
Farebrother held that view of things dangerous: Nature was more just
than that; it would be easy for any felon to say that his ancestors
ought to have been hanged instead of him.  If those who had bad fathers
and mothers were bad themselves, they were hanged for that. <second> There was
no need to go back on what you couldn't see. </second> </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">My mother is like old George the Third,</said> said the Vicar, <said who="#FB">she objects
to metaphysics.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MFB">I object to what is wrong, Camden.  I say, keep hold of a few plain
truths, and make everything square with them.  When I was young, Mr.
Lydgate, there never was any question about right and wrong.  We knew
our catechism, and that was enough; we learned our creed and our duty.
Every respectable Church person had the same opinions.  But now, if you
speak out of the Prayer-book itself, you are liable to be contradicted.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">That makes rather a pleasant time of it for those who like to maintain
their own point,</said> said Lydgate.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB"But my mother always gives way,</said> said the Vicar, slyly.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MFB">No, no, Camden, you must not lead Mr. Lydgate into a mistake about
<emph rend="italics">me</emph>. I shall never show that disrespect to my parents, to give up what
they taught me.  Any one may see what comes of turning.  If you change
once, why not twenty times?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">A man might see good arguments for changing once, and not see them for
changing again,</said> said Lydgate, amused with the decisive old lady.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MFB">Excuse me there.  If you go upon arguments, they are never wanting,
when a man has no constancy of mind.  My father never changed, and he
preached plain moral sermons without arguments, and was a good man—few
better.  When you get me a good man made out of arguments, I will get
you a good dinner with reading you the cookery-book. That's my opinion,
and I think anybody's stomach will bear me out.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">About the dinner certainly, mother,</said> said Mr. Farebrother.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MFB">It is the same thing, the dinner or the man.  I am nearly seventy, Mr.
Lydgate, and I go upon experience.  I am not likely to follow new
lights, though there are plenty of them here as elsewhere.  I say, they
came in with the mixed stuffs that will neither wash nor wear.  It was
not so in my youth: a Churchman was a Churchman, and a clergyman, you
might be pretty sure, was a gentleman, if nothing else.  But now he may
be no better than a Dissenter, and want to push aside my son on
pretence of doctrine.  But whoever may wish to push him aside, I am
proud to say, Mr. Lydgate, that he will compare with any preacher in
this kingdom, not to speak of this town, which is but a low standard to
go by; at least, to my thinking, for I was born and bred at Exeter.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">A mother is never partial,</said> said Mr. Farebrother, smiling.  <said who="#FB">What do
you think Tyke's mother says about him?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MFB">Ah, poor creature! what indeed?</said> said Mrs. Farebrother, her sharpness
blunted for the moment by her confidence in maternal judgments.  <said who="#MFB">She
says the truth to herself, depend upon it.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">And what is the truth?</said> said Lydgate. <said who="#Lyd">I am curious to know.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Oh, nothing bad at all,</said> said Mr. Farebrother.  <said who="#FB">He is a zealous
fellow: not very learned, and not very wise, I think—because I don't
agree with him.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Winifred">Why, Camden!</said> said Miss Winifred, <said who="#Winifred">Griffin and his wife told me only
to-day, that Mr. Tyke said they should have no more coals if they came
to hear you preach.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Farebrother laid down her knitting, which she had resumed after
her small allowance of tea and toast, and looked at her son as if to
say <said who="#Noble">You hear that?</said>  Miss Noble said, <said who="#Noble">Oh poor things! poor things!</said>
in reference, probably, to the double loss of preaching and coal.  But
the Vicar answered quietly—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">That is because they are not my parishioners.  And I don't think my
sermons are worth a load of coals to them.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MFB">Mr. Lydgate,</said> said Mrs. Farebrother, who could not let this pass, <said who="#MFB">you
don't know my son: he always undervalues himself.  I tell him he is
undervaluing the God who made him, and made him a most excellent
preacher.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">That must be a hint for me to take Mr. Lydgate away to my study,
mother,</said> said the Vicar, laughing.  <said who="#FB">I promised to show you my
collection,</said> he added, turning to Lydgate; <said who="#FB">shall we go?</said>
</P>

<P>
All three ladies remonstrated. <said who="#MFB" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mr. Lydgate ought not to be hurried
away without being allowed to accept another cup of tea: Miss Winifred
had abundance of good tea in the pot.  Why was Camden in such haste to
take a visitor to his den?  There was nothing but pickled vermin, and
drawers full of blue-bottles and moths, with no carpet on the floor.
Mr. Lydgate must excuse it.  A game at cribbage would be far better. </said>
In short, it was plain that a vicar might be adored by his womankind as
the king of men and preachers, and yet be held by them to stand in much
need of their direction.  Lydgate, with the usual shallowness of a
young bachelor, wondered that Mr. Farebrother had not taught them
better.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">My mother is not used to my having visitors who can take any interest
in my hobbies,</said> said the Vicar, as he opened the door of his study,
which was indeed as bare of luxuries for the body as the ladies had
implied, unless a short porcelain pipe and a tobacco-box were to be
excepted.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Men of your profession don't generally smoke,</said> he said.  Lydgate
smiled and shook his head.  <said who="#FB">Nor of mine either, properly, I suppose.
You will hear that pipe alleged against me by Bulstrode and Company.
They don't know how pleased the devil would be if I gave it up.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I understand.  You are of an excitable temper and want a sedative.  I
am heavier, and should get idle with it.  I should rush into idleness,
and stagnate there with all my might.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">And you mean to give it all to your work.  I am some ten or twelve
years older than you, and have come to a compromise.  I feed a weakness
or two lest they should get clamorous.  See,</said> continued the Vicar,
opening several small drawers, <said who="#FB">I fancy I have made an exhaustive study
of the entomology of this district.  I am going on both with the fauna
and flora; but I have at least done my insects well.  We are singularly
rich in orthoptera: I don't know whether—Ah! you have got hold of that
glass jar—you are looking into that instead of my drawers.  You don't
really care about these things?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Not by the side of this lovely anencephalous monster.  I have never
had time to give myself much to natural history.  I was early bitten
with an interest in structure, and it is what lies most directly in my
profession.  I have no hobby besides.  I have the sea to swim in there.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB" >Ah! you are a happy fellow,</said> said Mr. Farebrother, turning on his heel
and beginning to fill his pipe.  <said who="#FB">You don't know what it is to want
spiritual tobacco—bad emendations of old texts, or small items about a
variety of Aphis Brassicae, with the well-known signature of
Philomicron, for the 'Twaddler's Magazine;' or a learned treatise on
the entomology of the Pentateuch, including all the insects not
mentioned, but probably met with by the Israelites in their passage
through the desert; with a monograph on the Ant, as treated by Solomon,
showing the harmony of the Book of Proverbs with the results of modern
research.  You don't mind my fumigating you?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> Lydgate was more surprised at the openness of this talk than at its
implied meaning—that the Vicar felt himself not altogether in the
right vocation.  The neat fitting-up of drawers and shelves, and the
bookcase filled with expensive illustrated books on Natural History,
made him think again of the winnings at cards and their destination.
But he was beginning to wish that the very best construction of
everything that Mr. Farebrother did should be the true one.  The
Vicar's frankness seemed not of the repulsive sort that comes from an
uneasy consciousness seeking to forestall the judgment of others, but
simply the relief of a desire to do with as little pretence as
possible. </said> Apparently he was not without a sense that his freedom of
speech might seem premature, for he presently said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB">I have not yet told you that I have the advantage of you, Mr. Lydgate,
and know you better than you know me.  You remember Trawley who shared
your apartment at Paris for some time?  I was a correspondent of his,
and he told me a good deal about you.  I was not quite sure when you
first came that you were the same man.  I was very glad when I found
that you were.  Only I don't forget that you have not had the like
prologue about me.</said>
</P>

<P>
Lydgate divined some delicacy of feeling here, but did not half
understand it.  <said who="#Lyd"> By the way,</said> he said, <said who="#Lyd">what has become of Trawley?  I
have quite lost sight of him.  He was hot on the French social systems,
and talked of going to the Backwoods to found a sort of Pythagorean
community.  Is he gone?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Not at all.  He is practising at a German bath, and has married a rich
patient.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Then my notions wear the best, so far,</said> said Lydgate, with a short
scornful laugh.  <said who="#Lyd">He would have it, the medical profession was an
inevitable system of humbug.  I said, the fault was in the men—men who
truckle to lies and folly.  Instead of preaching against humbug outside
the walls, it might be better to set up a disinfecting apparatus
within.  In short—I am reporting my own conversation—you may be sure
I had all the good sense on my side.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Your scheme is a good deal more difficult to carry out than the
Pythagorean community, though.  You have not only got the old Adam in
yourself against you, but you have got all those descendants of the
original Adam who form the society around you.  You see, I have paid
twelve or thirteen years more than you for my knowledge of
difficulties.  But</said>—Mr. Farebrother broke off a moment, and then
added, <said who="#FB"> you are eying that glass vase again.  Do you want to make an
exchange?  You shall not have it without a fair barter.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I have some sea-mice—fine specimens—in spirits.  And I will throw in
Robert Brown's new thing—'Microscopic Observations on the Pollen of
Plants'—if you don't happen to have it already.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Why, seeing how you long for the monster, I might ask a higher price.
Suppose I ask you to look through my drawers and agree with me about
all my new species?</said>  The Vicar, while he talked in this way,
alternately moved about with his pipe in his mouth, and returned to
hang rather fondly over his drawers.  <said who="#FB">That would be good discipline,
you know, for a young doctor who has to please his patients in
Middlemarch.  You must learn to be bored, remember.  However, you shall
have the monster on your own terms.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">Don't you think men overrate the necessity for humoring everybody's
nonsense, till they get despised by the very fools they humor?</said> said
Lydgate, moving to Mr. Farebrother's side, and looking rather absently
at the insects ranged in fine gradation, with names subscribed in
exquisite writing.  <said who="#Lyd">The shortest way is to make your value felt, so
that people must put up with you whether you flatter them or not.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">With all my heart.  But then you must be sure of having the value, and
you must keep yourself independent.  Very few men can do that.  Either
you slip out of service altogether, and become good for nothing, or you
wear the harness and draw a good deal where your yoke-fellows pull you.
But do look at these delicate orthoptera!</said>
</P>

<P>
Lydgate had after all to give some scrutiny to each drawer, the Vicar
laughing at himself, and yet persisting in the exhibition.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd"> Apropos of what you said about wearing harness,</said> Lydgate began, after
they had sat down, <said who="#Lyd">I made up my mind some time ago to do with as
little of it as possible. That was why I determined not to try anything
in London, for a good many years at least.  I didn't like what I saw
when I was studying there—so much empty bigwiggism, and obstructive
trickery.  In the country, people have less pretension to knowledge,
and are less of companions, but for that reason they affect one's
amour-propre less: one makes less bad blood, and can follow one's own
course more quietly.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Yes—well—you have got a good start; you are in the right profession,
the work you feel yourself most fit for.  Some people miss that, and
repent too late.  But you must not be too sure of keeping your
independence.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">You mean of family ties?</said> said Lydgate, conceiving that these might
press rather tightly on Mr. Farebrother.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Not altogether.  Of course they make many things more difficult.  But
a good wife—a good unworldly woman—may really help a man, and keep
him more independent.  There's a parishioner of mine—a fine fellow,
but who would hardly have pulled through as he has done without his
wife.  Do you know the Garths?  I think they were not Peacock's
patients.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">No; but there is a Miss Garth at old Featherstone's, at Lowick.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Their daughter: an excellent girl.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">She is very quiet—I have hardly noticed her.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">She has taken notice of you, though, depend upon it.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I don't understand,</said> said Lydgate; he could hardly say <said>Of course.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Oh, she gauges everybody.  I prepared her for confirmation—she is a
favorite of mine.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Farebrother puffed a few moments in silence, Lydgate not caring to
know more about the Garths.  At last the Vicar laid down his pipe,
stretched out his legs, and turned his bright eyes with a smile towards
Lydgate, saying—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">But we Middlemarchers are not so tame as you take us to be.  We have
our intrigues and our parties.  I am a party man, for example, and
Bulstrode is another.  If you vote for me you will offend Bulstrode.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">What is there against Bulstrode?</said> said Lydgate, emphatically.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">I did not say there was anything against him except that.  If you vote
against him you will make him your enemy.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">I don't know that I need mind about that,</said> said Lydgate, rather
proudly; <said who="#Lyd">but he seems to have good ideas about hospitals, and he
spends large sums on useful public objects.  He might help me a good
deal in carrying out my ideas.  As to his religious notions—why, as
Voltaire said, incantations will destroy a flock of sheep if
administered with a certain quantity of arsenic.  I look for the man
who will bring the arsenic, and don't mind about his incantations.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">Very good.  But then you must not offend your arsenic-man. You will
not offend me, you know,</said> said Mr. Farebrother, quite unaffectedly.  <said who="#FB">I
don't translate my own convenience into other people's duties.  I am
opposed to Bulstrode in many ways.  I don't like the set he belongs to:
they are a narrow ignorant set, and do more to make their neighbors
uncomfortable than to make them better.  Their system is a sort of
worldly-spiritual cliqueism: they really look on the rest of mankind as
a doomed carcass which is to nourish them for heaven.  But,</said> he added,
smilingly, <said who="#FB">I don't say that Bulstrode's new hospital is a bad thing;
and as to his wanting to oust me from the old one—why, if he thinks me
a mischievous fellow, he is only returning a compliment.  And I am not
a model clergyman—only a decent makeshift.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> Lydgate was not at all sure that the Vicar maligned himself.  A model
clergyman, like a model doctor, ought to think his own profession the
finest in the world, and take all knowledge as mere nourishment to his
moral pathology and therapeutics.</said>  He only said, <said who="#Lyd">What reason does
Bulstrode give for superseding you?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">That I don't teach his opinions—which he calls spiritual religion;
and that I have no time to spare.  Both statements are true.  But then
I could make time, and I should be glad of the forty pounds.  That is
the plain fact of the case.  But let us dismiss it.  I only wanted to
tell you that if you vote for your arsenic-man, you are not to cut me
in consequence.  I can't spare you.  You are a sort of circumnavigator
come to settle among us, and will keep up my belief in the antipodes.
Now tell me all about them in Paris.</said>

</epigraph>

<BR/>

<P>
Some weeks passed after this conversation before the question of the
chaplaincy gathered any practical import for Lydgate, and without
telling himself the reason, he deferred the predetermination on which
side he should give his vote. <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> It would really have been a matter of
total indifference to him—that is to say, he would have taken the more
convenient side, and given his vote for the appointment of Tyke without
any hesitation—if he had not cared personally for Mr. Farebrother. </said>
</P>

<P>
But his liking for the Vicar of St. Botolph's grew with growing
acquaintanceship. <said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> That, entering into Lydgate's position as a
new-comer who had his own professional objects to secure, Mr.
Farebrother should have taken pains rather to warn off than to obtain
his interest, showed an unusual delicacy and generosity, which
Lydgate's nature was keenly alive to.  It went along with other points
of conduct in Mr. Farebrother which were exceptionally fine, and made
his character resemble those southern landscapes which seem divided
between natural grandeur and social slovenliness.  Very few men could
have been as filial and chivalrous as he was to the mother, aunt, and
sister, whose dependence on him had in many ways shaped his life rather
uneasily for himself; few men who feel the pressure of small needs are
so nobly resolute not to dress up their inevitably self-interested
desires in a pretext of better motives.  In these matters he was
conscious that his life would bear the closest scrutiny; and perhaps
the consciousness encouraged a little defiance towards the critical
strictness of persons whose celestial intimacies seemed not to improve
their domestic manners, and whose lofty aims were not needed to account
for their actions.  Then, his preaching was ingenious and pithy, like
the preaching of the English Church in its robust age, and his sermons
were delivered without book.  People outside his parish went to hear
him; and, since to fill the church was always the most difficult part
of a clergyman's function, here was another ground for a careless sense
of superiority. <first> Besides, he was a likable man: sweet-tempered,
ready-witted, frank, without grins of suppressed bitterness or other
conversational flavors which make half of us an affliction to our
friends. </first> Lydgate liked him heartily, and wished for his friendship. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> With this feeling uppermost, he continued to waive the question of the
chaplaincy, and to persuade himself that it was not only no proper
business of his, but likely enough never to vex him with a demand for
his vote. </said> Lydgate, at Mr. Bulstrode's request, was laying down plans
for the internal arrangements of the new hospital, and the two were

often in consultation. The banker was always presupposing that he
could count in general on Lydgate as a coadjutor, but made no special
recurrence to the coming decision between Tyke and Farebrother. When
>>>>>>> a69b22142a1542eac6a0c1bfd824c4d1ef9a7a78
the General Board of the Infirmary had met, however, and Lydgate had
notice that the question of the chaplaincy was thrown on a council of
the directors and medical men, to meet on the following Friday, he had
a vexed sense that he must make up his mind on this trivial Middlemarch
business.  He could not help hearing within him the distinct
declaration that Bulstrode was prime minister, and that the Tyke affair
was a question of office or no office; and he could not help an equally
pronounced dislike to giving up the prospect of office.  For his
observation was constantly confirming Mr. Farebrother's assurance that
the banker would not overlook opposition.  <FID who="#Lyd"> Confound their petty
politics!</FID> was one of his thoughts for three mornings in the meditative
process of shaving, when he had begun to feel that he must really hold
a court of conscience on this matter.  Certainly there were valid
things to be said against the election of Mr. Farebrother: he had too
much on his hands already, especially considering how much time he
spent on non-clerical occupations.  Then again it was a continually
repeated shock, disturbing Lydgate's esteem, that the Vicar should
obviously play for the sake of money, liking the play indeed, but
evidently liking some end which it served.  Mr. Farebrother contended
on theory for the desirability of all games, and said that Englishmen's
wit was stagnant for want of them; but Lydgate felt certain that he
would have played very much less but for the money. </said> There was a
billiard-room at the Green Dragon, which some anxious mothers and wives
regarded as the chief temptation in Middlemarch. The Vicar was a
first-rate billiard-player, and though he did not frequent the Green
Dragon, there were reports that he had sometimes been there in the
daytime and had won money.  And as to the chaplaincy, he did not
pretend that he cared for it, except for the sake of the forty pounds.
Lydgate was no Puritan, but he did not care for play, and winning money
at it had always seemed a meanness to him; besides, he had an ideal of
life which made this subservience of conduct to the gaining of small
sums thoroughly hateful to him.  Hitherto in his own life his wants had
been supplied without any trouble to himself, and his first impulse was
always to be liberal with half-crowns as matters of no importance to a
gentleman; it had never occurred to him to devise a plan for getting
half-crowns.  He had always known in a general way that he was not
rich, but he had never felt poor, and he had no power of imagining the
part which the want of money plays in determining the actions of men.
Money had never been a motive to him.  Hence he was not ready to frame
excuses for this deliberate pursuit of small gains.  It was altogether
repulsive to him, and he never entered into any calculation of the
ratio between the Vicar's income and his more or less necessary
expenditure.  It was possible that he would not have made such a
calculation in his own case.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> And now, when the question of voting had come, this repulsive fact told
more strongly against Mr. Farebrother than it had done before.  One
would know much better what to do if men's characters were more
consistent, and especially if one's friends were invariably fit for any
function they desired to undertake!  Lydgate was convinced that if
there had been no valid objection to Mr. Farebrother, he would have
voted for him, whatever Bulstrode might have felt on the subject: he
did not intend to be a vassal of Bulstrode's. On the other hand, there
was Tyke, a man entirely given to his clerical office, who was simply
curate at a chapel of ease in St. Peter's parish, and had time for
extra duty.  Nobody had anything to say against Mr. Tyke, except that
they could not bear him, and suspected him of cant.  Really, from his
point of view, Bulstrode was thoroughly justified. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> But whichever way Lydgate began to incline, there was something to make
him wince; and being a proud man, he was a little exasperated at being
obliged to wince.  He did not like frustrating his own best purposes by
getting on bad terms with Bulstrode; he did not like voting against
Farebrother, and helping to deprive him of function and salary; and the
question occurred whether the additional forty pounds might not leave
the Vicar free from that ignoble care about winning at cards.
Moreover, Lydgate did not like the consciousness that in voting for
Tyke he should be voting on the side obviously convenient for himself.
But would the end really be his own convenience?  Other people would
say so, and would allege that he was currying favor with Bulstrode for
the sake of making himself important and getting on in the world.  What
then?  He for his own part knew that if his personal prospects simply
had been concerned, he would not have cared a rotten nut for the
banker's friendship or enmity.  What he really cared for was a medium
for his work, a vehicle for his ideas; and after all, was he not bound
to prefer the object of getting a good hospital, where he could
demonstrate the specific distinctions of fever and test therapeutic
results, before anything else connected with this chaplaincy?  For the
first time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of
small social conditions, and their frustrating complexity.  At the end
of his inward debate, when he set out for the hospital, his hope was
really in the chance that discussion might somehow give a new aspect to
the question, and make the scale dip so as to exclude the necessity for
voting. <first> I think he trusted a little also to the energy which is
begotten by circumstances—some feeling rushing warmly and making
resolve easy, while debate in cool blood had only made it more
difficult. </first> However it was, he did not distinctly say to himself on
which side he would vote; and all the while he was inwardly resenting
the subjection which had been forced upon him.  It would have seemed
beforehand like a ridiculous piece of bad logic that he, with his
unmixed resolutions of independence and his select purposes, would find
himself at the very outset in the grasp of petty alternatives, each of
which was repugnant to him.  In his student's chambers, he had
prearranged his social action quite differently. </said>
</P>

<P>
Lydgate was late in setting out, but Dr. Sprague, the two other
surgeons, and several of the directors had arrived early; Mr.
Bulstrode, treasurer and chairman, being among those who were still
absent.  The conversation seemed to imply that the issue was
problematical, and that a majority for Tyke was not so certain as had
been generally supposed.  The two physicians, for a wonder, turned out
to be unanimous, or rather, though of different minds, they concurred
in action. <said who="#MM" direct="false" aloud="false"> Dr. Sprague, the rugged and weighty, was, as every one had
foreseen, an adherent of Mr. Farebrother.  The Doctor was more than
suspected of having no religion, but somehow Middlemarch tolerated this
deficiency in him as if he had been a Lord Chancellor; indeed it is
probable that his professional weight was the more believed in, the
world-old association of cleverness with the evil principle being still
potent in the minds even of lady-patients who had the strictest ideas
of frilling and sentiment.  It was perhaps this negation in the Doctor
which made his neighbors call him hard-headed and dry-witted;
conditions of texture which were also held favorable to the storing of
judgments connected with drugs.  At all events, it is certain that if
any medical man had come to Middlemarch with the reputation of having
very definite religious views, of being given to prayer, and of
otherwise showing an active piety, there would have been a general
presumption against his medical skill. </said>
</P>

<P>
On this ground it was (professionally speaking) fortunate for Dr.
Minchin that his religious sympathies were of a general kind, and such
as gave a distant medical sanction to all serious sentiment, whether of
Church or Dissent, rather than any adhesion to particular tenets. <said who="#Minchin" direct="false" aloud="false"> If
Mr. Bulstrode insisted, as he was apt to do, on the Lutheran doctrine
of justification, as that by which a Church must stand or fall, Dr.
Minchin in return was quite sure that man was not a mere machine or a
fortuitous conjunction of atoms; if Mrs. Wimple insisted on a
particular providence in relation to her stomach complaint, Dr. Minchin
for his part liked to keep the mental windows open and objected to
fixed limits; if the Unitarian brewer jested about the Athanasian
Creed, Dr. Minchin quoted Pope's <said>Essay on Man.</said>.  He objected to the
rather free style of anecdote in which Dr. Sprague indulged, preferring
well-sanctioned quotations, and liking refinement of all kinds: it was
generally known that he had some kinship to a bishop, and sometimes
spent his holidays at <said>the palace.</said> </said>
</P>

<P>
Dr. Minchin was soft-handed, pale-complexioned, and of rounded outline,
not to be distinguished from a mild clergyman in appearance: whereas
Dr. Sprague was superfluously tall; his trousers got creased at the
knees, and showed an excess of boot at a time when straps seemed
necessary to any dignity of bearing; you heard him go in and out, and
up and down, as if he had come to see after the roofing. <said who="#MM" direct="false" aloud="false"> In short, he
had weight, and might be expected to grapple with a disease and throw
it; while Dr. Minchin might be better able to detect it lurking and to
circumvent it. </said> They enjoyed about equally the mysterious privilege of
medical reputation, and concealed with much etiquette their contempt
for each other's skill.  Regarding themselves as Middlemarch
institutions, they were ready to combine against all innovators, and
against non-professionals given to interference.  On this ground they
were both in their hearts equally averse to Mr. Bulstrode, though Dr.
Minchin had never been in open hostility with him, and never differed
from him without elaborate explanation to Mrs. Bulstrode, who had found
that Dr. Minchin alone understood her constitution. <said who="#Minchin" direct="false" aloud="false"> A layman who pried
into the professional conduct of medical men, and was always obtruding
his reforms,—though he was less directly embarrassing to the two
physicians than to the surgeon-apothecaries who attended paupers by
contract, was nevertheless offensive to the professional nostril as
such; and Dr. Minchin shared fully in the new pique against Bulstrode,
excited by his apparent determination to patronize Lydgate. </said> <said who="#Wrench" direct="false" aloud="false">The
long-established practitioners, Mr. Wrench and Mr. Toller; were just
now standing apart and having a friendly colloquy, in which they agreed
that Lydgate was a jackanapes, just made to serve Bulstrode's purpose. </said>
To non-medical friends they had already concurred in praising the other
young practitioner, who had come into the town on Mr. Peacock's
retirement without further recommendation than his own merits and such
argument for solid professional acquirement as might be gathered from
his having apparently wasted no time on other branches of knowledge.
It was clear that Lydgate, by not dispensing drugs, intended to cast
imputations on his equals, and also to obscure the limit between his
own rank as a general practitioner and that of the physicians, who, in
the interest of the profession, felt bound to maintain its various
grades,—especially against a man who had not been to either of the
English universities and enjoyed the absence of anatomical and bedside
study there, but came with a libellous pretension to experience in
Edinburgh and Paris, where observation might be abundant indeed, but
hardly sound.
</P>

<P>
Thus it happened that on this occasion Bulstrode became identified with
Lydgate, and Lydgate with Tyke; and owing to this variety of
interchangeable names for the chaplaincy question, diverse minds were
enabled to form the same judgment concerning it.
</P>

<P>
Dr. Sprague said at once bluntly to the group assembled when he
entered, <said who="#Sprague">I go for Farebrother.  A salary, with all my heart.  But why
take it from the Vicar?  He has none too much—has to insure his life,
besides keeping house, and doing a vicar's charities.  Put forty pounds
in his pocket and you'll do no harm.  He's a good fellow, is
Farebrother, with as little of the parson about him as will serve to
carry orders.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Powderell">Ho, ho!  Doctor,</said> said old Mr. Powderell, a retired iron-monger of
some standing—his interjection being something between a laugh and a
Parliamentary disapproval; <said who="#Powderell">we must let you have your say.  But what we
have to consider is not anybody's income—it's the souls of the poor
sick people </said> —here Mr. Powderell's voice and face had a sincere pathos
in them.  <said who="#Powderell"> He is a real Gospel preacher, is Mr. Tyke.  I should vote
against my conscience if I voted against Mr. Tyke—I should indeed.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hackbutt"> Mr. Tyke's opponents have not asked any one to vote against his
conscience, I believe,</said> said Mr. Hackbutt, a rich tanner of fluent
speech, whose glittering spectacles and erect hair were turned with
some severity towards innocent Mr. Powderell.  <said who="#Hackbutt">But in my judgment it
behoves us, as Directors, to consider whether we will regard it as our
whole business to carry out propositions emanating from a single
quarter.  Will any member of the committee aver that he would have
entertained the idea of displacing the gentleman who has always
discharged the function of chaplain here, if it had not been suggested
to him by parties whose disposition it is to regard every institution
of this town as a machinery for carrying out their own views?  I tax no
man's motives: let them lie between himself and a higher Power; but I
do say, that there are influences at work here which are incompatible
with genuine independence, and that a crawling servility is usually
dictated by circumstances which gentlemen so conducting themselves
could not afford either morally or financially to avow.  I myself am a
layman, but I have given no inconsiderable attention to the divisions
in the Church and—</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hawley">Oh, damn the divisions!</said> burst in Mr. Frank Hawley, lawyer and
town-clerk, who rarely presented himself at the board, but now looked
in hurriedly, whip in hand.  <said who="#Hawley">We have nothing to do with them here.
Farebrother has been doing the work—what there was—without pay, and
if pay is to be given, it should be given to him.  I call it a
confounded job to take the thing away from Farebrother.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Plymdale">I think it would be as well for gentlemen not to give their remarks a
personal bearing,</said> said Mr. Plymdale.  <said who="#Plymdale">I shall vote for the
appointment of Mr. Tyke, but I should not have known, if Mr. Hackbutt
hadn't hinted it, that I was a Servile Crawler.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hackbutt">I disclaim any personalities.  I expressly said, if I may be allowed
to repeat, or even to conclude what I was about to say—</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hawley">Ah, here's Minchin!</said> said Mr. Frank Hawley; at which everybody turned
away from Mr. Hackbutt, leaving him to feel the uselessness of superior
gifts in Middlemarch.  <said who="#Hawley">Come, Doctor, I must have you on the right
side, eh?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Minchin">I hope so,</said> said Dr. Minchin, nodding and shaking hands here and
there; <said who="#Minchin">at whatever cost to my feelings.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hawley">If there's any feeling here, it should be feeling for the man who is
turned out, I think,</said> said Mr. Frank Hawley.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Minchin">I confess I have feelings on the other side also.  I have a divided
esteem,</said> said Dr. Minchin, rubbing his hands.  <said who="#Minchin">I consider Mr. Tyke an
exemplary man—none more so—and I believe him to be proposed from
unimpeachable motives.  I, for my part, wish that I could give him my
vote.  But I am constrained to take a view of the case which gives the
preponderance to Mr. Farebrother's claims.  He is an amiable man, an
able preacher, and has been longer among us.</said>
</P>

<P>
Old Mr. Powderell looked on, sad and silent.  Mr. Plymdale settled his
cravat, uneasily.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Larcher">You don't set up Farebrother as a pattern of what a clergyman ought to
be, I hope,</said> said Mr. Larcher, the eminent carrier, who had just come
in.  <said who="#Larcher">I have no ill-will towards him, but I think we owe something to
the public, not to speak of anything higher, in these appointments.  In
my opinion Farebrother is too lax for a clergyman.  I don't wish to
bring up particulars against him; but he will make a little attendance
here go as far as he can.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hawley">And a devilish deal better than too much,</said> said Mr. Hawley, whose bad
language was notorious in that part of the county.  <said who="#Hawley">Sick people can't
bear so much praying and preaching.  And that methodistical sort of
religion is bad for the spirits—bad for the inside, eh?</said> he added,
turning quickly round to the four medical men who were assembled.
</P>

<P>
But any answer was dispensed with by the entrance of three gentlemen,
with whom there were greetings more or less cordial.  These were the
Reverend Edward Thesiger, Rector of St. Peter's, Mr. Bulstrode, and our
friend Mr. Brooke of Tipton, who had lately allowed himself to be put
on the board of directors in his turn, but had never before attended,
his attendance now being due to Mr. Bulstrode's exertions.  Lydgate was
the only person still expected.
</P>

<P>
Every one now sat down, Mr. Bulstrode presiding, pale and
self-restrained as usual. <said who="#Thesiger" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mr. Thesiger, a moderate evangelical, wished
for the appointment of his friend Mr. Tyke, a zealous able man, who,
officiating at a chapel of ease, had not a cure of souls too extensive
to leave him ample time for the new duty.  It was desirable that
chaplaincies of this kind should be entered on with a fervent
intention: they were peculiar opportunities for spiritual influence;
and while it was good that a salary should be allotted, there was the
more need for scrupulous watching lest the office should be perverted
into a mere question of salary. </said> Mr. Thesiger's manner had so much
quiet propriety that objectors could only simmer in silence.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#MB" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mr. Brooke believed that everybody meant well in the matter.  He had
not himself attended to the affairs of the Infirmary, though he had a
strong interest in whatever was for the benefit of Middlemarch, and was
most happy to meet the gentlemen present on any public question— <said who="#MB"> any
public question, you know,</said> Mr. Brooke repeated, with his nod of
perfect understanding. </said> <said who="#MB">I am a good deal occupied as a magistrate, and
in the collection of documentary evidence, but I regard my time as
being at the disposal of the public—and, in short, my friends have
convinced me that a chaplain with a salary—a salary, you know—is a
very good thing, and I am happy to be able to come here and vote for
the appointment of Mr. Tyke, who, I understand, is an unexceptionable
man, apostolic and eloquent and everything of that kind—and I am the
last man to withhold my vote—under the circumstances, you know.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hawley">It seems to me that you have been crammed with one side of the
question, Mr. Brooke,</said> said Mr. Frank Hawley, who was afraid of nobody,
and was a Tory suspicious of electioneering intentions.  <said who="#Hawley">You don't
seem to know that one of the worthiest men we have has been doing duty
as chaplain here for years without pay, and that Mr. Tyke is proposed
to supersede him.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">Excuse me, Mr. Hawley,</said> said Mr. Bulstrode.  <said who="#B">Mr. Brooke has been
fully informed of Mr. Farebrother's character and position.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hawley">By his enemies,</said> flashed out Mr. Hawley.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Thesinger">I trust there is no personal hostility concerned here,</said> said Mr.
Thesiger.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hawley">I'll swear there is, though,</said> retorted Mr. Hawley.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">Gentlemen,</said> said Mr. Bulstrode, in a subdued tone, <said who="#B">the merits of the
question may be very briefly stated, and if any one present doubts that
every gentleman who is about to give his vote has not been fully
informed, I can now recapitulate the considerations that should weigh
on either side.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Hawley">I don't see the good of that,</said> said Mr. Hawley.  <said who="#Hawley">I suppose we all
know whom we mean to vote for.  Any man who wants to do justice does
not wait till the last minute to hear both sides of the question.  I
have no time to lose, and I propose that the matter be put to the vote
at once.</said>
</P>

<P>
A brief but still hot discussion followed before each person wrote
<said>Tyke</said> or <said>Farebrother</said> on a piece of paper and slipped it into a glass
tumbler; and in the mean time Mr. Bulstrode saw Lydgate enter.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#B">I perceive that the votes are equally divided at present,</said> said Mr.
Bulstrode, in a clear biting voice.  Then, looking up at Lydgate—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">There is a casting-vote still to be given.  It is yours, Mr. Lydgate:
will you be good enough to write?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Wrench">The thing is settled now,</said> said Mr. Wrench, rising.  <said who="#Wrench">We all know how
Mr. Lydgate will vote.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">You seem to speak with some peculiar meaning, sir,</said> said Lydgate,
rather defiantly, and keeping his pencil suspended.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Wrench">I merely mean that you are expected to vote with Mr. Bulstrode.  Do
you regard that meaning as offensive?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd">It may be offensive to others.  But I shall not desist from voting
with him on that account.</said>  Lydgate immediately wrote down <said>Tyke.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> So the Rev. Walter Tyke became chaplain to the Infirmary, and Lydgate
continued to work with Mr. Bulstrode.  He was really uncertain whether
Tyke were not the more suitable candidate, and yet his consciousness
told him that if he had been quite free from indirect bias he should
have voted for Mr. Farebrother.  The affair of the chaplaincy remained
a sore point in his memory as a case in which this petty medium of
Middlemarch had been too strong for him.  How could a man be satisfied
with a decision between such alternatives and under such circumstances?
No more than he can be satisfied with his hat, which he has chosen from
among such shapes as the resources of the age offer him, wearing it at
best with a resignation which is chiefly supported by comparison. </said>
</P>

<P>
But Mr. Farebrother met him with the same friendliness as before. <first> The
character of the publican and sinner is not always practically
incompatible with that of the modern Pharisee, for the majority of us
scarcely see more distinctly the faultiness of our own conduct than the
faultiness of our own arguments, or the dulness of our own jokes. </first> <said who="#FB" direct="false" aloud="false"> But
the Vicar of St. Botolph's had certainly escaped the slightest tincture
of the Pharisee, and by dint of admitting to himself that he was too
much as other men were, he had become remarkably unlike them in
this—that he could excuse others for thinking slightly of him, and
could judge impartially of their conduct even when it told against him. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#FB">The world has been too strong for <emph rend="italics">me</emph>, I know,</said> he said one day to
Lydgate.  <said who="#FB">But then I am not a mighty man—I shall never be a man of
renown.  The choice of Hercules is a pretty fable; but Prodicus makes
it easy work for the hero, as if the first resolves were enough.
Another story says that he came to hold the distaff, and at last wore
the Nessus shirt.  I suppose one good resolve might keep a man right if
everybody else's resolve helped him.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lyd" direct="false" aloud="false"> <first> The Vicar's talk was not always inspiriting: he had escaped being a
Pharisee, but he had not escaped that low estimate of possibilities
which we rather hastily arrive at as an inference from our own failure.
Lydgate thought that there was a pitiable infirmity of will in Mr.
Farebrother. </first> </said>

When George the Fourth was still reigning over the privacies of
Windsor, when the Duke of Wellington was Prime Minister, and Mr. Vincy
was mayor of the old corporation in Middlemarch, Mrs. Casaubon, born
Dorothea Brooke, had taken her wedding journey to Rome.  In those days
the world in general was more ignorant of good and evil by forty years
than it is at present.  Travellers did not often carry full information
on Christian art either in their heads or their pockets; and even the
most brilliant English critic of the day mistook the flower-flushed
tomb of the ascended Virgin for an ornamental vase due to the painter's
fancy.  Romanticism, which has helped to fill some dull blanks with
love and knowledge, had not yet penetrated the times with its leaven
and entered into everybody's food; it was fermenting still as a
distinguishable vigorous enthusiasm in certain long-haired German
artists at Rome, and the youth of other nations who worked or idled
near them were sometimes caught in the spreading movement.
</P>

<P>
One fine morning a young man whose hair was not immoderately long, but
abundant and curly, and who was otherwise English in his equipment, had
just turned his back on the Belvedere Torso in the Vatican and was
looking out on the magnificent view of the mountains from the adjoining
round vestibule.  He was sufficiently absorbed not to notice the
approach of a dark-eyed, animated German who came up to him and placing
a hand on his shoulder, said with a strong accent, <said who="#Naumann">Come here, quick!
else she will have changed her pose.</said>
</P>

<P>
Quickness was ready at the call, and the two figures passed lightly
along by the Meleager, towards the hall where the reclining Ariadne,
then called the Cleopatra, lies in the marble voluptuousness of her
beauty, the drapery folding around her with a petal-like ease and
tenderness.  They were just in time to see another figure standing
against a pedestal near the reclining marble: a breathing blooming
girl, whose form, not shamed by the Ariadne, was clad in Quakerish gray
drapery; her long cloak, fastened at the neck, was thrown backward from
her arms, and one beautiful ungloved hand pillowed her cheek, pushing
somewhat backward the white beaver bonnet which made a sort of halo to
her face around the simply braided dark-brown hair.  She was not
looking at the sculpture, probably not thinking of it: her large eyes
were fixed dreamily on a streak of sunlight which fell across the
floor.  But she became conscious of the two strangers who suddenly
paused as if to contemplate the Cleopatra, and, without looking at
them, immediately turned away to join a maid-servant and courier who
were loitering along the hall at a little distance off.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">What do you think of that for a fine bit of antithesis?</said> said the
German, searching in his friend's face for responding admiration, but
going on volubly without waiting for any other answer.  <said who="#Naumann">There lies
antique beauty, not corpse-like even in death, but arrested in the
complete contentment of its sensuous perfection: and here stands beauty
in its breathing life, with the consciousness of Christian centuries in
its bosom.  But she should be dressed as a nun; I think she looks
almost what you call a Quaker; I would dress her as a nun in my
picture.  However, she is married; I saw her wedding-ring on that
wonderful left hand, otherwise I should have thought the sallow
<i>Geistlicher</i> was her father.  I saw him parting from her a good while
ago, and just now I found her in that magnificent pose.  Only think! he
is perhaps rich, and would like to have her portrait taken.  Ah! it is
no use looking after her—there she goes!  Let us follow her home!</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">No, no,</said> said his companion, with a little frown.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">You are singular, Ladislaw.  You look struck together.  Do you know
her?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I know that she is married to my cousin,</said> said Will Ladislaw,
sauntering down the hall with a preoccupied air, while his German
friend kept at his side and watched him eagerly.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">What! the <i>Geistlicher</i>? He looks more like an uncle—a more useful sort
of relation.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">He is not my uncle.  I tell you he is my second cousin,</said> said
Ladislaw, with some irritation.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">Schön, schön.  Don't be snappish.  You are not angry with me for
thinking Mrs. Second-Cousin the most perfect young Madonna I ever saw?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Angry? nonsense.  I have only seen her once before, for a couple of
minutes, when my cousin introduced her to me, just before I left
England.  They were not married then.  I didn't know they were coming
to Rome.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">But you will go to see them now—you will find out what they have for
an address—since you know the name.  Shall we go to the post?  And you
could speak about the portrait.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Confound you, Naumann!  I don't know what I shall do.  I am not so
brazen as you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">Bah! that is because you are dilettantish and amateurish.  If you were
an artist, you would think of Mistress Second-Cousin as antique form
animated by Christian sentiment—a sort of Christian Antigone—sensuous
force controlled by spiritual passion.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Yes, and that your painting her was the chief outcome of her
existence—the divinity passing into higher completeness and all but
exhausted in the act of covering your bit of canvas.  I am amateurish
if you like: I do <emph rend="italics">not</emph> think that all the universe is straining
towards the obscure significance of your pictures.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">But it is, my dear!—so far as it is straining through me, Adolf
Naumann: that stands firm,</said> said the good-natured painter, putting a
hand on Ladislaw's shoulder, and not in the least disturbed by the
unaccountable touch of ill-humor in his tone.  <said who="#Naumann">See now!  My existence
presupposes the existence of the whole universe—does it <emph rend="italics">not?</emph> and my
function is to paint—and as a painter I have a conception which is
altogether <i>genialisch</i>, of your great-aunt or second grandmother as a
subject for a picture; therefore, the universe is straining towards
that picture through that particular hook or claw which it puts forth
in the shape of me—not true?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">But how if another claw in the shape of me is straining to thwart
it?—the case is a little less simple then.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">Not at all: the result of the struggle is the same thing—picture or
no picture—logically.</said>
</P>

<P>
Will could not resist this imperturbable temper, and the cloud in his
face broke into sunshiny laughter.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">Come now, my friend—you will help?</said> said Naumann, in a hopeful tone.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">No; nonsense, Naumann!  English ladies are not at everybody's service
as models.  And you want to express too much with your painting.  You
would only have made a better or worse portrait with a background which
every connoisseur would give a different reason for or against.  And
what is a portrait of a woman?  Your painting and Plastik are poor
stuff after all.  They perturb and dull conceptions instead of raising
them.  Language is a finer medium.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">Yes, for those who can't paint,</said> said Naumann.  <said who="#Naumann">There you have
perfect right.  I did not recommend you to paint, my friend.</said>
</P>

<P>
The amiable artist carried his sting, but Ladislaw did not choose to
appear stung.  He went on as if he had not heard.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Language gives a fuller image, which is all the better for being
vague.  After all, the true seeing is within; and painting stares at
you with an insistent imperfection.  I feel that especially about
representations of women.  As if a woman were a mere colored
superficies!  You must wait for movement and tone.  There is a
difference in their very breathing: they change from moment to
moment.—This woman whom you have just seen, for example: how would you
paint her voice, pray?  But her voice is much diviner than anything you
have seen of her.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">I see, I see.  You are jealous.  No man must presume to think that he
can paint your ideal.  This is serious, my friend!  Your great-aunt!
'Der Neffe als Onkel' in a tragic sense—<i>ungeheuer!</i></said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">You and I shall quarrel, Naumann, if you call that lady my aunt again.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">How is she to be called then?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Mrs. Casaubon.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">Good.  Suppose I get acquainted with her in spite of you, and find
that she very much wishes to be painted?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad"> <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false">Yes, suppose!</said> said Will Ladislaw, in a contemptuous undertone,
intended to dismiss the subject.  He was conscious of being irritated
by ridiculously small causes, which were half of his own creation.  Why
was he making any fuss about Mrs. Casaubon?  And yet he felt as if
something had happened to him with regard to her. </said> There are characters
which are continually creating collisions and nodes for themselves in
dramas which nobody is prepared to act with them.  Their
susceptibilities will clash against objects that remain innocently
quiet.

          <said>A child forsaken, waking suddenly,

<P>
Two hours later, Dorothea was seated in an inner room or boudoir of a
handsome apartment in the Via Sistina.
</P>

<P>
<first> I am sorry to add that she was sobbing bitterly, with such abandonment
to this relief of an oppressed heart as a woman habitually controlled
by pride on her own account and thoughtfulness for others will
sometimes allow herself when she feels securely alone. </first> <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> And Mr.
Casaubon was certain to remain away for some time at the Vatican. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> Yet Dorothea had no distinctly shapen grievance that she could state
even to herself; and in the midst of her confused thought and passion,
the mental act that was struggling forth into clearness was a
self-accusing cry that her feeling of desolation was the fault of her
own spiritual poverty.  She had married the man of her choice, and with
the advantage over most girls that she had contemplated her marriage
chiefly as the beginning of new duties: from the very first she had
thought of Mr. Casaubon as having a mind so much above her own, that he
must often be claimed by studies which she could not entirely share;
moreover, after the brief narrow experience of her girlhood she was
beholding Rome, the city of visible history, where the past of a whole
hemisphere seems moving in funeral procession with strange ancestral
images and trophies gathered from afar. </said>
</P>

<P>
But this stupendous fragmentariness heightened the dreamlike
strangeness of her bridal life.  Dorothea had now been five weeks in
Rome, and in the kindly mornings when autumn and winter seemed to go
hand in hand like a happy aged couple one of whom would presently
survive in chiller loneliness, she had driven about at first with Mr.
Casaubon, but of late chiefly with Tantripp and their experienced
courier.  She had been led through the best galleries, had been taken
to the chief points of view, had been shown the grandest ruins and the
most glorious churches, and she had ended by oftenest choosing to drive
out to the Campagna where she could feel alone with the earth and sky,
away-from the oppressive masquerade of ages, in which her own life too
seemed to become a masque with enigmatical costumes.
</P>

<P>
To those who have looked at Rome with the quickening power of a
knowledge which breathes a growing soul into all historic shapes, and
traces out the suppressed transitions which unite all contrasts, Rome
may still be the spiritual centre and interpreter of the world.  But
let them conceive one more historical contrast: the gigantic broken
revelations of that Imperial and Papal city thrust abruptly on the
notions of a girl who had been brought up in English and Swiss
Puritanism, fed on meagre Protestant histories and on art chiefly of
the hand-screen sort; a girl whose ardent nature turned all her small
allowance of knowledge into principles, fusing her actions into their
mould, and whose quick emotions gave the most abstract things the
quality of a pleasure or a pain; a girl who had lately become a wife,
and from the enthusiastic acceptance of untried duty found herself
plunged in tumultuous preoccupation with her personal lot.  The weight
of unintelligible Rome might lie easily on bright nymphs to whom it
formed a background for the brilliant picnic of Anglo-foreign society;
but Dorothea had no such defence against deep impressions.  Ruins and
basilicas, palaces and colossi, set in the midst of a sordid present,
where all that was living and warm-blooded seemed sunk in the deep
degeneracy of a superstition divorced from reverence; the dimmer but
yet eager Titanic life gazing and struggling on walls and ceilings; the
long vistas of white forms whose marble eyes seemed to hold the
monotonous light of an alien world: all this vast wreck of ambitious
ideals, sensuous and spiritual, mixed confusedly with the signs of
breathing forgetfulness and degradation, at first jarred her as with an
electric shock, and then urged themselves on her with that ache
belonging to a glut of confused ideas which check the flow of emotion.
Forms both pale and glowing took possession of her young sense, and
fixed themselves in her memory even when she was not thinking of them,
preparing strange associations which remained through her after-years.
<first> Our moods are apt to bring with them images which succeed each other
like the magic-lantern pictures of a doze; and in certain states of
dull forlornness Dorothea all her life continued to see the vastness of
St. Peter's, the huge bronze canopy, the excited intention in the
attitudes and garments of the prophets and evangelists in the mosaics
above, and the red drapery which was being hung for Christmas spreading
itself everywhere like a disease of the retina. </first>
</P>

<P>
Not that this inward amazement of Dorothea's was anything very
exceptional: many souls in their young nudity are tumbled out among
incongruities and left to <said>find their feet</said> among them, while their
elders go about their business. <first>  Nor can I suppose that when Mrs.
Casaubon is discovered in a fit of weeping six weeks after her wedding,
the situation will be regarded as tragic. </first> <first> Some discouragement, some
faintness of heart at the new real future which replaces the imaginary,
is not unusual, and we do not expect people to be deeply moved by what
is not unusual. </first> <first> That element of tragedy which lies in the very fact of
frequency, has not yet wrought itself into the coarse emotion of
mankind; and perhaps our frames could hardly bear much of it. </first> <first> If we
had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be
like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel's heart beat, and we
should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence. </first> <first> As it
is, the quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity. </first>
</P>

<P>
<first> However, Dorothea was crying, and if she had been required to state the
cause, she could only have done so in some such general words as I have
already used: to have been driven to be more particular would have been
like trying to give a history of the lights and shadows, for that new
real future which was replacing the imaginary drew its material from
the endless minutiae by which her view of Mr. Casaubon and her wifely
relation, now that she was married to him, was gradually changing with
the secret motion of a watch-hand from what it had been in her maiden
dream. </first> It was too early yet for her fully to recognize or at least
admit the change, still more for her to have readjusted that
devotedness which was so necessary a part of her mental life that she
was almost sure sooner or later to recover it.  Permanent rebellion,
the disorder of a life without some loving reverent resolve, was not
possible to her; but she was now in an interval when the very force of
her nature heightened its confusion.  In this way, the early months of
marriage often are times of critical tumult—whether that of a
shrimp-pool or of deeper waters—which afterwards subsides into
cheerful peace.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> But was not Mr. Casaubon just as learned as before?  Had his forms of
expression changed, or his sentiments become less laudable?  Oh
waywardness of womanhood! did his chronology fail him, or his ability
to state not only a theory but the names of those who held it; or his
provision for giving the heads of any subject on demand?  And was not
Rome the place in all the world to give free play to such
accomplishments?  Besides, had not Dorothea's enthusiasm especially
dwelt on the prospect of relieving the weight and perhaps the sadness
with which great tasks lie on him who has to achieve them?—  And that
such weight pressed on Mr. Casaubon was only plainer than before. </said>
</P>

<P>
<second> All these are crushing questions; but whatever else remained the same,
the light had changed, and you cannot find the pearly dawn at noonday. </second>
The fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are
acquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few
imaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of
married companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than
what you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether
the same. <first> And it would be astonishing to find how soon the change is
felt if we had no kindred changes to compare with it. </first> <first> To share
lodgings with a brilliant dinner-companion, or to see your favorite
politician in the Ministry, may bring about changes quite as rapid: in
these cases too we begin by knowing little and believing much, and we
sometimes end by inverting the quantities. </first>
</P>

<P>
Still, such comparisons might mislead, for no man was more incapable of
flashy make-believe than Mr. Casaubon: he was as genuine a character as
any ruminant animal, and he had not actively assisted in creating any
illusions about himself. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> How was it that in the weeks since her
marriage, Dorothea had not distinctly observed but felt with a stifling
depression, that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she had
dreamed of finding in her husband's mind were replaced by anterooms and
winding passages which seemed to lead nowhither? </said> <first> I suppose it was that
in courtship everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary, and
the smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee
delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal. </first> But
the door-sill of marriage once crossed, expectation is concentrated on
the present. <second> Having once embarked on your marital voyage, it is
impossible not to be aware that you make no way and that the sea is not
within sight—that, in fact, you are exploring an enclosed basin. </second>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> In their conversation before marriage, Mr. Casaubon had often dwelt on
some explanation or questionable detail of which Dorothea did not see
the bearing; but such imperfect coherence seemed due to the brokenness
of their intercourse, and, supported by her faith in their future, she
had listened with fervid patience to a recitation of possible arguments
to be brought against Mr. Casaubon's entirely new view of the
Philistine god Dagon and other fish-deities, thinking that hereafter
she should see this subject which touched him so nearly from the same
high ground whence doubtless it had become so important to him.  Again,
the matter-of-course statement and tone of dismissal with which he
treated what to her were the most stirring thoughts, was easily
accounted for as belonging to the sense of haste and preoccupation in
which she herself shared during their engagement.  But now, since they
had been in Rome, with all the depths of her emotion roused to
tumultuous activity, and with life made a new problem by new elements,
she had been becoming more and more aware, with a certain terror, that
her mind was continually sliding into inward fits of anger and
repulsion, or else into forlorn weariness.  How far the judicious
Hooker or any other hero of erudition would have been the same at Mr.
Casaubon's time of life, she had no means of knowing, so that he could
not have the advantage of comparison; but her husband's way of
commenting on the strangely impressive objects around them had begun to
affect her with a sort of mental shiver: he had perhaps the best
intention of acquitting himself worthily, but only of acquitting
himself.  What was fresh to her mind was worn out to his; and such
capacity of thought and feeling as had ever been stimulated in him by
the general life of mankind had long shrunk to a sort of dried
preparation, a lifeless embalmment of knowledge. </said>
</P>

<P>
When he said, <said who="#C">Does this interest you, Dorothea?  Shall we stay a
little longer?  I am ready to stay if you wish it,</said>—it seemed to her
as if going or staying were alike dreary.  Or, <said who="#C"> Should you like to go
to the Farnesina, Dorothea?  It contains celebrated frescos designed or
painted by Raphael, which most persons think it worth while to visit.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">But do you care about them?</said> was always Dorothea's question.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">They are, I believe, highly esteemed.  Some of them represent the
fable of Cupid and Psyche, which is probably the romantic invention of
a literary period, and cannot, I think, be reckoned as a genuine
mythical product.  But if you like these wall-paintings we can easily
drive thither; and you will then, I think, have seen the chief works of
Raphael, any of which it were a pity to omit in a visit to Rome.  He is
the painter who has been held to combine the most complete grace of
form with sublimity of expression.  Such at least I have gathered to be
the opinion of cognoscenti.</said>
</P>

<P>
This kind of answer given in a measured official tone, as of a
clergyman reading according to the rubric, did not help to justify the
glories of the Eternal City, or to give her the hope that if she knew
more about them the world would be joyously illuminated for her.  There
is hardly any contact more depressing to a young ardent creature than
that of a mind in which years full of knowledge seem to have issued in
a blank absence of interest or sympathy.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> On other subjects indeed Mr. Casaubon showed a tenacity of occupation
and an eagerness which are usually regarded as the effect of
enthusiasm, and Dorothea was anxious to follow this spontaneous
direction of his thoughts, instead of being made to feel that she
dragged him away from it.  But she was gradually ceasing to expect with
her former delightful confidence that she should see any wide opening
where she followed him.  Poor Mr. Casaubon himself was lost among small
closets and winding stairs, and in an agitated dimness about the
Cabeiri, or in an exposure of other mythologists' ill-considered
parallels, easily lost sight of any purpose which had prompted him to
these labors.  With his taper stuck before him he forgot the absence of
windows, and in bitter manuscript remarks on other men's notions about
the solar deities, he had become indifferent to the sunlight. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> These characteristics, fixed and unchangeable as bone in Mr. Casaubon,
might have remained longer unfelt by Dorothea if she had been
encouraged to pour forth her girlish and womanly feeling—if he would
have held her hands between his and listened with the delight of
tenderness and understanding to all the little histories which made up
her experience, and would have given her the same sort of intimacy in
return, so that the past life of each could be included in their mutual
knowledge and affection—or if she could have fed her affection with
those childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman, who
has begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald doll,
creating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own
love.  That was Dorothea's bent.  With all her yearning to know what
was afar from her and to be widely benignant, she had ardor enough for
what was near, to have kissed Mr. Casaubon's coat-sleeve, or to have
caressed his shoe-latchet, if he would have made any other sign of
acceptance than pronouncing her, with his unfailing propriety, to be of
a most affectionate and truly feminine nature, indicating at the same
time by politely reaching a chair for her that he regarded these
manifestations as rather crude and startling. <said who="#D"> <said who="#C" direct="false" aloud="false" direct="false" aloud="false"> Having made his clerical
toilet with due care in the morning, he was prepared only for those
amenities of life which were suited to the well-adjusted stiff cravat
of the period, and to a mind weighted with unpublished matter. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> And by a sad contradiction Dorothea's ideas and resolves seemed like
melting ice floating and lost in the warm flood of which they had been
but another form.  She was humiliated to find herself a mere victim of
feeling, as if she could know nothing except through that medium: all
her strength was scattered in fits of agitation, of struggle, of
despondency, and then again in visions of more complete renunciation,
transforming all hard conditions into duty. </said> Poor Dorothea! she was
certainly troublesome—to herself chiefly; but this morning for the
first time she had been troublesome to Mr. Casaubon.
</P>

<P>
She had begun, while they were taking coffee, with a determination to
shake off what she inwardly called her selfishness, and turned a face
all cheerful attention to her husband when he said, <said who="#C">My dear Dorothea,
we must now think of all that is yet left undone, as a preliminary to
our departure.  I would fain have returned home earlier that we might
have been at Lowick for the Christmas; but my inquiries here have been
protracted beyond their anticipated period.  I trust, however, that the
time here has not been passed unpleasantly to you.  Among the sights of
Europe, that of Rome has ever been held one of the most striking and in
some respects edifying.  I well remember that I considered it an epoch
in my life when I visited it for the first time; after the fall of
Napoleon, an event which opened the Continent to travellers.  Indeed I
think it is one among several cities to which an extreme hyperbole has
been applied—'See Rome and die:' but in your case I would propose an
emendation and say, See Rome as a bride, and live henceforth as a happy
wife.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Casaubon pronounced this little speech with the most conscientious
intention, blinking a little and swaying his head up and down, and
concluding with a smile. <said who="#C" direct="false" aloud="false">  He had not found marriage a rapturous state,
but he had no idea of being anything else than an irreproachable
husband, who would make a charming young woman as happy as she deserved
to be. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I hope you are thoroughly satisfied with our stay—I mean, with the
result so far as your studies are concerned,</said> said Dorothea, trying to
keep her mind fixed on what most affected her husband.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">Yes,</said> said Mr. Casaubon, with that peculiar pitch of voice which makes
the word half a negative.  <said who="#C">I have been led farther than I had
foreseen, and various subjects for annotation have presented themselves
which, though I have no direct need of them, I could not pretermit.
The task, notwithstanding the assistance of my amanuensis, has been a
somewhat laborious one, but your society has happily prevented me from
that too continuous prosecution of thought beyond the hours of study
which has been the snare of my solitary life.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I am very glad that my presence has made any difference to you,</said> said
Dorothea, who had a vivid memory of evenings in which she had supposed
that Mr. Casaubon's mind had gone too deep during the day to be able to
get to the surface again. I fear there was a little temper in her
reply.  <said who="#D">I hope when we get to Lowick, I shall be more useful to you,
and be able to enter a little more into what interests you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">Doubtless, my dear,</said> said Mr. Casaubon, with a slight bow.  <said who="#B">The notes
I have here made will want sifting, and you can, if you please, extract
them under my direction.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">And all your notes,</said> said Dorothea, whose heart had already burned
within her on this subject, so that now she could not help speaking
with her tongue.  <said who="#D">All those rows of volumes—will you not now do what
you used to speak of?—will you not make up your mind what part of them
you will use, and begin to write the book which will make your vast
knowledge useful to the world?  I will write to your dictation, or I
will copy and extract what you tell me: I can be of no other use.</said>
<said who="#C" direct="false" aloud="false"> Dorothea, in a most unaccountable, darkly feminine manner, ended with a
slight sob and eyes full of tears. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C" direct="false" aloud="false"> The excessive feeling manifested would alone have been highly
disturbing to Mr. Casaubon, but there were other reasons why Dorothea's
words were among the most cutting and irritating to him that she could
have been impelled to use. <first> She was as blind to his inward troubles as
he to hers: she had not yet learned those hidden conflicts in her
husband which claim our pity. </said></first> She had not yet listened patiently to
his heartbeats, but only felt that her own was beating violently.  In
Mr. Casaubon's ear, Dorothea's voice gave loud emphatic iteration to
those muffled suggestions of consciousness which it was possible to
explain as mere fancy, the illusion of exaggerated sensitiveness:
always when such suggestions are unmistakably repeated from without,
they are resisted as cruel and unjust. <first> We are angered even by the full
acceptance of our humiliating confessions—how much more by hearing in
hard distinct syllables from the lips of a near observer, those
confused murmurs which we try to call morbid, and strive against as if
they were the oncoming of numbness! </first> <said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> And this cruel outward accuser was
there in the shape of a wife—nay, of a young bride, who, instead of
observing his abundant pen-scratches and amplitude of paper with the
uncritical awe of an elegant-minded canary-bird, seemed to present
herself as a spy watching everything with a malign power of inference.
Here, towards this particular point of the compass, Mr. Casaubon had a
sensitiveness to match Dorothea's, and an equal quickness to imagine
more than the fact.  He had formerly observed with approbation her
capacity for worshipping the right object; he now foresaw with sudden
terror that this capacity might be replaced by presumption, this
worship by the most exasperating of all criticism,—that which sees
vaguely a great many fine ends, and has not the least notion what it
costs to reach them. </said>
</P>

<P>
For the first time since Dorothea had known him, Mr. Casaubon's face
had a quick angry flush upon it.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">My love,</said> he said, with irritation reined in by propriety, <said who="#C">you may
rely upon me for knowing the times and the seasons, adapted to the
different stages of a work which is not to be measured by the facile
conjectures of ignorant onlookers.  It had been easy for me to gain a
temporary effect by a mirage of baseless opinion; but it is ever the
trial of the scrupulous explorer to be saluted with the impatient scorn
of chatterers who attempt only the smallest achievements, being indeed
equipped for no other.  And it were well if all such could be
admonished to discriminate judgments of which the true subject-matter
lies entirely beyond their reach, from those of which the elements may
be compassed by a narrow and superficial survey.</said>
</P>

<P>
This speech was delivered with an energy and readiness quite unusual
with Mr. Casaubon.  It was not indeed entirely an improvisation, but
had taken shape in inward colloquy, and rushed out like the round
grains from a fruit when sudden heat cracks it. <said who="#B" direct="false" aloud="false"> Dorothea was not only
his wife: she was a personification of that shallow world which
surrounds the appreciated or desponding author. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> Dorothea was indignant in her turn.  Had she not been repressing
everything in herself except the desire to enter into some fellowship
with her husband's chief interests? </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">My judgment <emph rend="italics">was</emph> a very superficial one—such as I am capable of
forming,</said> she answered, with a prompt resentment, that needed no
rehearsal.  <said who="#D">You showed me the rows of notebooks—you have often spoken
of them—you have often said that they wanted digesting.  But I never
heard you speak of the writing that is to be published.  Those were
very simple facts, and my judgment went no farther.  I only begged you
to let me be of some good to you.</said>
</P>

<P>
Dorothea rose to leave the table and Mr. Casaubon made no reply, taking
up a letter which lay beside him as if to reperuse it.  Both were
shocked at their mutual situation—that each should have betrayed anger
towards the other.  If they had been at home, settled at Lowick in
ordinary life among their neighbors, the clash would have been less
embarrassing: but on a wedding journey, the express object of which is
to isolate two people on the ground that they are all the world to each
other, the sense of disagreement is, to say the least, confounding and
stultifying.  <second> To have changed your longitude extensively and placed
yourselves in a moral solitude in order to have small explosions, to
find conversation difficult and to hand a glass of water without
looking, can hardly be regarded as satisfactory fulfilment even to the
toughest minds. </second> <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> To Dorothea's inexperienced sensitiveness, it seemed
like a catastrophe, changing all prospects; </said> <said who="#C" direct="false" aloud="false"> and to Mr. Casaubon it was
a new pain, he never having been on a wedding journey before, or found
himself in that close union which was more of a subjection than he had
been able to imagine, since this charming young bride not only obliged
him to much consideration on her behalf (which he had sedulously
given), but turned out to be capable of agitating him cruelly just
where he most needed soothing.  Instead of getting a soft fence against
the cold, shadowy, unapplausive audience of his life, had he only given
it a more substantial presence? </said>
</P>

<P>
Neither of them felt it possible to speak again at present. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> To have
reversed a previous arrangement and declined to go out would have been
a show of persistent anger which Dorothea's conscience shrank from,
seeing that she already began to feel herself guilty.  However just her
indignation might be, her ideal was not to claim justice, but to give
tenderness. </said> So when the carriage came to the door, she drove with Mr.
Casaubon to the Vatican, walked with him through the stony avenue of
inscriptions, and when she parted with him at the entrance to the
Library, went on through the Museum out of mere listlessness as to what
was around her.  She had not spirit to turn round and say that she
would drive anywhere.  It was when Mr. Casaubon was quitting her that
Naumann had first seen her, and he had entered the long gallery of
sculpture at the same time with her; but here Naumann had to await
Ladislaw with whom he was to settle a bet of champagne about an
enigmatical mediaeval-looking figure there.  After they had examined
the figure, and had walked on finishing their dispute, they had parted,
Ladislaw lingering behind while Naumann had gone into the Hall of
Statues where he again saw Dorothea, and saw her in that brooding
abstraction which made her pose remarkable. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> She did not really see the
streak of sunlight on the floor more than she saw the statues: she was
inwardly seeing the light of years to come in her own home and over the
English fields and elms and hedge-bordered highroads; and feeling that
the way in which they might be filled with joyful devotedness was not
so clear to her as it had been.  But in Dorothea's mind there was a
current into which all thought and feeling were apt sooner or later to
flow—the reaching forward of the whole consciousness towards the
fullest truth, the least partial good.  There was clearly something
better than anger and despondency. </said>

It was in that way Dorothea came to be sobbing as soon as she was
securely alone.  But she was presently roused by a knock at the door,
which made her hastily dry her eyes before saying, <said who="#D">Come in.</said> Tantripp
had brought a card, and said that there was a gentleman waiting in the
lobby. <said who="#courier" direct="false" aloud="false"> The courier had told him that only Mrs. Casaubon was at home,
but he said he was a relation of Mr. Casaubon's: would she see him? </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Yes,</said> said Dorothea, without pause; <said who="#D">show him into the salon.</said> <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> Her
chief impressions about young Ladislaw were that when she had seen him
at Lowick she had been made aware of Mr. Casaubon's generosity towards
him, and also that she had been interested in his own hesitation about
his career.  She was alive to anything that gave her an opportunity for
active sympathy, and at this moment it seemed as if the visit had come
to shake her out of her self-absorbed discontent—to remind her of her
husband's goodness, and make her feel that she had now the right to be
his helpmate in all kind deeds. </said> <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> She waited a minute or two, but when
she passed into the next room there were just signs enough that she had
been crying to make her open face look more youthful and appealing than
usual.  She met Ladislaw with that exquisite smile of good-will which
is unmixed with vanity, and held out her hand to him. </said> <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> He was the elder
by several years, but at that moment he looked much the younger, for
his transparent complexion flushed suddenly, and he spoke with a
shyness extremely unlike the ready indifference of his manner with his
male companion, while Dorothea became all the calmer with a wondering
desire to put him at ease. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I was not aware that you and Mr. Casaubon were in Rome, until this
morning, when I saw you in the Vatican Museum,</said> he said.  <said who="#Lad">I knew you
at once—but—I mean, that I concluded Mr. Casaubon's address would be
found at the Poste Restante, and I was anxious to pay my respects to
him and you as early as possible.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Pray sit down.  He is not here now, but he will be glad to hear of
you, I am sure,</said> said Dorothea, seating herself unthinkingly between
the fire and the light of the tall window, and pointing to a chair
opposite, with the quietude of a benignant matron. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> The signs of
girlish sorrow in her face were only the more striking. </said> <said who="#D">Mr. Casaubon
is much engaged; but you will leave your address—will you not?—and
he will write to you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">You are very good,</said> said Ladislaw, beginning to lose his diffidence in
the interest with which he was observing the signs of weeping which had
altered her face.  <said who="#Lad">My address is on my card.  But if you will allow me
I will call again to-morrow at an hour when Mr. Casaubon is likely to
be at home.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">He goes to read in the Library of the Vatican every day, and you can
hardly see him except by an appointment.  Especially now.  We are about
to leave Rome, and he is very busy.  He is usually away almost from
breakfast till dinner.  But I am sure he will wish you to dine with us.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> Will Ladislaw was struck mute for a few moments.  He had never been
fond of Mr. Casaubon, and if it had not been for the sense of
obligation, would have laughed at him as a Bat of erudition.  But the
idea of this dried-up pedant, this elaborator of small explanations
about as important as the surplus stock of false antiquities kept in a
vendor's back chamber, having first got this adorable young creature to
marry him, and then passing his honeymoon away from her, groping after
his mouldy futilities (Will was given to hyperbole)—this sudden
picture stirred him with a sort of comic disgust: he was divided
between the impulse to laugh aloud and the equally unseasonable impulse
to burst into scornful invective. </said>
</P>

<P>
For an instant he felt that the struggle was causing a queer
contortion of his mobile features, but with a good effort he resolved
it into nothing more offensive than a merry smile.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> Dorothea wondered; but the smile was irresistible, and shone back from
her face too.  Will Ladislaw's smile was delightful, unless you were
angry with him beforehand: it was a gush of inward light illuminating
the transparent skin as well as the eyes, and playing about every curve
and line as if some Ariel were touching them with a new charm, and
banishing forever the traces of moodiness.  The reflection of that
smile could not but have a little merriment in it too, even under dark
eyelashes still moist, as Dorothea said inquiringly, <said who="#D">Something amuses
you?</said> </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Yes,</said> said Will, quick in finding resources.  <said who="#Lad">I am thinking of the
sort of figure I cut the first time I saw you, when you annihilated my
poor sketch with your criticism.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">My criticism?</said> said Dorothea, wondering still more.  <said who="#D">Surely not.  I
always feel particularly ignorant about painting.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I suspected you of knowing so much, that you knew how to say just what
was most cutting.  You said—I dare say you don't remember it as I
do—that the relation of my sketch to nature was quite hidden from you.
At least, you implied that.</said>  Will could laugh now as well as smile.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">That was really my ignorance,</said> said Dorothea, admiring
Will's good-humor. <said who="#D">I must have said so only because I never could see
any beauty in the pictures which my uncle told me all judges thought
very fine.  And I have gone about with just the same ignorance in Rome.
There are comparatively few paintings that I can really enjoy.  At
first when I enter a room where the walls are covered with frescos, or
with rare pictures, I feel a kind of awe—like a child present at great
ceremonies where there are grand robes and processions; I feel myself
in the presence of some higher life than my own.  But when I begin to
examine the pictures one by one the life goes out of them, or else is
something violent and strange to me.  It must be my own dulness.  I am
seeing so much all at once, and not understanding half of it.  That
always makes one feel stupid.  It is painful to be told that anything
is very fine and not be able to feel that it is fine—something like
being blind, while people talk of the sky.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Oh, there is a great deal in the feeling for art which must be
acquired,</said> said Will. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> (It was impossible now to doubt the directness
of Dorothea's confession.) </said> <said who="#Lad">Art is an old language with a great many
artificial affected styles, and sometimes the chief pleasure one gets
out of knowing them is the mere sense of knowing.  I enjoy the art of
all sorts here immensely; but I suppose if I could pick my enjoyment to
pieces I should find it made up of many different threads.  There is
something in daubing a little one's self, and having an idea of the
process.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">You mean perhaps to be a painter?</said> said Dorothea, with a new direction
of interest.  <said who="#D">You mean to make painting your profession?  Mr. Casaubon
will like to hear that you have chosen a profession.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">No, oh no,</said> said Will, with some coldness.  <said who="#Lad">I have quite made up my
mind against it.  It is too one-sided a life.  I have been seeing a
great deal of the German artists here: I travelled from Frankfort with
one of them.  Some are fine, even brilliant fellows—but I should not
like to get into their way of looking at the world entirely from the
studio point of view.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">That I can understand,</said> said Dorothea, cordially.  <said who="#D">And in Rome it
seems as if there were so many things which are more wanted in the
world than pictures.  But if you have a genius for painting, would it
not be right to take that as a guide?  Perhaps you might do better
things than these—or different, so that there might not be so many
pictures almost all alike in the same place.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> There was no mistaking this simplicity, and Will was won by it into
frankness. </said> <said who="#Lad">A man must have a very rare genius to make changes of that
sort.  I am afraid mine would not carry me even to the pitch of doing
well what has been done already, at least not so well as to make it
worth while.  And I should never succeed in anything by dint of
drudgery.  If things don't come easily to me I never get them.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I have heard Mr. Casaubon say that he regrets your want of patience,</said>
said Dorothea, gently.  She was rather shocked at this mode of taking
all life as a holiday.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Yes, I know Mr. Casaubon's opinion.  He and I differ.</said>
</P>

<P>
The slight streak of contempt in this hasty reply offended Dorothea.
She was all the more susceptible about Mr. Casaubon because of her
morning's trouble.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Certainly you differ,</said> she said, rather proudly.  <said who="#D">I did not think of
comparing you: such power of persevering devoted labor as Mr.
Casaubon's is not common.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> Will saw that she was offended, but this only gave an additional
impulse to the new irritation of his latent dislike towards Mr.
Casaubon.  It was too intolerable that Dorothea should be worshipping
this husband: such weakness in a woman is pleasant to no man but the
husband in question. </said> Mortals are easily tempted to pinch the life out
of their neighbor's buzzing glory, and think that such killing is no
murder.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">No, indeed,</said> he answered, promptly.  <said who="#Lad">And therefore it is a pity that
it should be thrown away, as so much English scholarship is, for want
of knowing what is being done by the rest of the world.  If Mr.
Casaubon read German he would save himself a great deal of trouble.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I do not understand you,</said> said Dorothea, startled and anxious.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I merely mean,</said> said Will, in an offhand way, <said who="#Lad">that the Germans have
taken the lead in historical inquiries, and they laugh at results which
are got by groping about in woods with a pocket-compass while they have
made good roads.  When I was with Mr. Casaubon I saw that he deafened
himself in that direction: it was almost against his will that he read
a Latin treatise written by a German.  I was very sorry.</said>
</P>

<P>
Will only thought of giving a good pinch that would annihilate that
vaunted laboriousness, and was unable to imagine the mode in which
Dorothea would be wounded. Young Mr. Ladislaw was not at all deep
himself in German writers; but very little achievement is required in
order to pity another man's shortcomings.
</P>

<P>
Poor Dorothea felt a pang at the thought that the labor of her
husband's life might be void, which left her no energy to spare for the
question whether this young relative who was so much obliged to him
ought not to have repressed his observation. She did not even speak,
but sat looking at her hands, absorbed in the piteousness of that
thought.
</P>

<P>
Will, however, having given that annihilating pinch, was rather
ashamed, imagining from Dorothea's silence that he had offended her
still more; and having also a conscience about plucking the
tail-feathers from a benefactor.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I regretted it especially,</said> he resumed, taking the usual course from
detraction to insincere eulogy, <said who="#Lad">because of my gratitude and respect
towards my cousin.  It would not signify so much in a man whose talents
and character were less distinguished.</said>
</P>

<P>
Dorothea raised her eyes, brighter than usual with excited feeling, and
said in her saddest recitative, <said who="#D">How I wish I had learned German when I
was at Lausanne!  There were plenty of German teachers.  But now I can
be of no use.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> There was a new light, but still a mysterious light, for Will in
Dorothea's last words.  The question how she had come to accept Mr.
Casaubon—which he had dismissed when he first saw her by saying that
she must be disagreeable in spite of appearances—was not now to be
answered on any such short and easy method.  Whatever else she might
be, she was not disagreeable.  She was not coldly clever and indirectly
satirical, but adorably simple and full of feeling.  She was an angel
beguiled.  It would be a unique delight to wait and watch for the
melodious fragments in which her heart and soul came forth so directly
and ingenuously.  The Aeolian harp again came into his mind. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> She must have made some original romance for herself in this marriage.
And if Mr. Casaubon had been a dragon who had carried her off to his
lair with his talons simply and without legal forms, it would have been
an unavoidable feat of heroism to release her and fall at her feet. </said>
But he was something more unmanageable than a dragon: he was a
benefactor with collective society at his back, and he was at that
moment entering the room in all the unimpeachable correctness of his
demeanor, while Dorothea was looking animated with a newly roused alarm
and regret, and Will was looking animated with his admiring speculation
about her feelings.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Casaubon felt a surprise which was quite unmixed with pleasure, but
he did not swerve from his usual politeness of greeting, when Will rose
and explained his presence.  Mr. Casaubon was less happy than usual,
and this perhaps made him look all the dimmer and more faded; else, the
effect might easily have been produced by the contrast of his young
cousin's appearance.  The first impression on seeing Will was one of
sunny brightness, which added to the uncertainty of his changing
expression.  Surely, his very features changed their form, his jaw
looked sometimes large and sometimes small; and the little ripple in
his nose was a preparation for metamorphosis.  When he turned his head
quickly his hair seemed to shake out light, and some persons thought
they saw decided genius in this coruscation.  Mr. Casaubon, on the
contrary, stood rayless.
</P>

<P>
As Dorothea's eyes were turned anxiously on her husband she was perhaps
not insensible to the contrast, but it was only mingled with other
causes in making her more conscious of that new alarm on his behalf
which was the first stirring of a pitying tenderness fed by the
realities of his lot and not by her own dreams.  Yet it was a source of
greater freedom to her that Will was there; his young equality was
agreeable, and also perhaps his openness to conviction.  She felt an
immense need of some one to speak to, and she had never before seen any
one who seemed so quick and pliable, so likely to understand everything.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mr. Casaubon gravely hoped that Will was passing his time profitably as
well as pleasantly in Rome—had thought his intention was to remain in
South Germany—but begged him to come and dine to-morrow, when he could
converse more at large: at present he was somewhat weary. </said> Ladislaw
understood, and accepting the invitation immediately took his leave.
</P>

<P>
Dorothea's eyes followed her husband anxiously, while he sank down
wearily at the end of a sofa, and resting his elbow supported his head
and looked on the floor.  A little flushed, and with bright eyes, she
seated herself beside him, and said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Forgive me for speaking so hastily to you this morning.  I was wrong.
I fear I hurt you and made the day more burdensome.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">I am glad that you feel that, my dear,</said> said Mr. Casaubon.  He spoke
quietly and bowed his head a little, but there was still an uneasy
feeling in his eyes as he looked at her.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">But you do forgive me?</said> said Dorothea, with a quick sob.<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false">  In her need
for some manifestation of feeling she was ready to exaggerate her own
fault.  Would not love see returning penitence afar off, and fall on
its neck and kiss it? </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">My dear Dorothea—'who with repentance is not satisfied, is not of
heaven nor earth:'—you do not think me worthy to be banished by that
severe sentence,</said> said Mr. Casaubon, exerting himself to make a strong
statement, and also to smile faintly.
</P>

<P>
Dorothea was silent, but a tear which had come up with the sob would
insist on falling.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">You are excited, my dear. And I also am feeling some unpleasant
consequences of too much mental disturbance,</said> said Mr. Casaubon. <said who="#C" direct="false" aloud="false"> In
fact, he had it in his thought to tell her that she ought not to have
received young Ladislaw in his absence: but he abstained, partly from
the sense that it would be ungracious to bring a new complaint in the
moment of her penitent acknowledgment, partly because he wanted to
avoid further agitation of himself by speech, and partly because he was
too proud to betray that jealousy of disposition which was not so
exhausted on his scholarly compeers that there was none to spare in
other directions. </said> There is a sort of jealousy which needs very little
fire: it is hardly a passion, but a blight bred in the cloudy, damp
despondency of uneasy egoism.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">I think it is time for us to dress,</said> he added, looking at his watch.
They both rose, and there was never any further allusion between them
to what had passed on this day.
</P>

<P>
<first> But Dorothea remembered it to the last with the vividness with which we
all remember epochs in our experience when some dear expectation dies,
or some new motive is born. </first> <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> Today she had begun to see that she had
been under a wild illusion in expecting a response to her feeling from
Mr. Casaubon, and she had felt the waking of a presentiment that there
might be a sad consciousness in his life which made as great a need on
his side as on her own. </said>
</P>

<P>
<first> We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder
to feed our supreme selves: Dorothea had early begun to emerge from
that stupidity, but yet it had been easier to her to imagine how she
would devote herself to Mr. Casaubon, and become wise and strong in his
strength and wisdom, than to conceive with that distinctness which is
no longer reflection but feeling—an idea wrought back to the
directness of sense, like the solidity of objects—that he had an
equivalent centre of self, whence the lights and shadows must always
fall with a certain difference. </first>

<P>
Will Ladislaw was delightfully agreeable at dinner the next day, and
gave no opportunity for Mr. Casaubon to show disapprobation. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> On the
contrary it seemed to Dorothea that Will had a happier way of drawing
her husband into conversation and of deferentially listening to him
than she had ever observed in any one before.  To be sure, the
listeners about Tipton were not highly gifted! </said> Will talked a good deal
himself, but what he said was thrown in with such rapidity, and with
such an unimportant air of saying something by the way, that it seemed
a gay little chime after the great bell. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> If Will was not always
perfect, this was certainly one of his good days.  He described touches
of incident among the poor people in Rome, only to be seen by one who
could move about freely; he found himself in agreement with Mr.
Casaubon as to the unsound opinions of Middleton concerning the
relations of Judaism and Catholicism; and passed easily to a
half-enthusiastic half-playful picture of the enjoyment he got out of
the very miscellaneousness of Rome, which made the mind flexible with
constant comparison, and saved you from seeing the world's ages as a
set of box-like partitions without vital connection. </said> Mr. Casaubon's
studies, Will observed, had always been of too broad a kind for that,
and he had perhaps never felt any such sudden effect, but for himself
he confessed that Rome had given him quite a new sense of history as a
whole: the fragments stimulated his imagination and made him
constructive.  Then occasionally, but not too often, he appealed to
Dorothea, and discussed what she said, as if her sentiment were an item
to be considered in the final judgment even of the Madonna di Foligno
or the Laocoon.  A sense of contributing to form the world's opinion
makes conversation particularly cheerful; and Mr. Casaubon too was not
without his pride in his young wife, who spoke better than most women,
as indeed he had perceived in choosing her.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> Since things were going on so pleasantly, Mr. Casaubon's statement that
his labors in the Library would be suspended for a couple of days, and
that after a brief renewal he should have no further reason for staying
in Rome, encouraged Will to urge that Mrs. Casaubon should not go away
without seeing a studio or two.  Would not Mr. Casaubon take her?  That
sort of thing ought not to be missed: it was quite special: it was a
form of life that grew like a small fresh vegetation with its
population of insects on huge fossils.  Will would be happy to conduct
them—not to anything wearisome, only to a few examples. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mr. Casaubon, seeing Dorothea look earnestly towards him, could not but
ask her if she would be interested in such visits: he was now at her
service during the whole day; and it was agreed that Will should come
on the morrow and drive with them. </said>
</P>

<P>
Will could not omit Thorwaldsen, a living celebrity about whom even Mr.
Casaubon inquired, but before the day was far advanced he led the way
to the studio of his friend Adolf Naumann, whom he mentioned as one of
the chief renovators of Christian art, one of those who had not only
revived but expanded that grand conception of supreme events as
mysteries at which the successive ages were spectators, and in relation
to which the great souls of all periods became as it were
contemporaries.  Will added that he had made himself Naumann's pupil
for the nonce.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I have been making some oil-sketches under him,</said> said Will.  <said who="#Lad">I hate
copying.  I must put something of my own in.  Naumann has been painting
the Saints drawing the Car of the Church, and I have been making a
sketch of Marlowe's Tamburlaine Driving the Conquered Kings in his
Chariot.  I am not so ecclesiastical as Naumann, and I sometimes twit
him with his excess of meaning.  But this time I mean to outdo him in
breadth of intention.  I take Tamburlaine in his chariot for the
tremendous course of the world's physical history lashing on the
harnessed dynasties.  In my opinion, that is a good mythical
interpretation.</said>  Will here looked at Mr. Casaubon, who received this
offhand treatment of symbolism very uneasily, and bowed with a neutral
air.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">The sketch must be very grand, if it conveys so much,</said> said Dorothea.
<said who="#D">I should need some explanation even of the meaning you give.  Do you
intend Tamburlaine to represent earthquakes and volcanoes?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Oh yes,</said> said Will, laughing, <said who="#Lad">and migrations of races and clearings
of forests—and America and the steam-engine. Everything you can
imagine!</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">What a difficult kind of shorthand!</said> said Dorothea, smiling towards
her husband.  <said who="#D">It would require all your knowledge to be able to read
it.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C" direct="false" aloud="false"> Mr. Casaubon blinked furtively at Will.  He had a suspicion that he was
being laughed at.  But it was not possible to include Dorothea in the
suspicion. </said>
</P>

<P>
They found Naumann painting industriously, but no model was present;
his pictures were advantageously arranged, and his own plain vivacious
person set off by a dove-colored blouse and a maroon velvet cap, so
that everything was as fortunate as if he had expected the beautiful
young English lady exactly at that time.
</P>

<P>
The painter in his confident English gave little dissertations on his
finished and unfinished subjects, seeming to observe Mr. Casaubon as
much as he did Dorothea.  Will burst in here and there with ardent
words of praise, marking out particular merits in his friend's work;
and <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> Dorothea felt that she was getting quite new notions as to the
significance of Madonnas seated under inexplicable canopied thrones
with the simple country as a background, and of saints with
architectural models in their hands, or knives accidentally wedged in
their skulls.  Some things which had seemed monstrous to her were
gathering intelligibility and even a natural meaning: but all this was
apparently a branch of knowledge in which Mr. Casaubon had not
interested himself. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I think I would rather feel that painting is beautiful than have to
read it as an enigma; but I should learn to understand these pictures
sooner than yours with the very wide meaning,</said> said Dorothea, speaking
to Will.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Don't speak of my painting before Naumann,</said> said Will.  <said who="#Lad">He will tell
you, it is all <i>pfuscherei</i>, which is his most opprobrious word!</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Is that true?</said> said Dorothea, turning her sincere eyes on Naumann, who
made a slight grimace and said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">Oh, he does not mean it seriously with painting.  His walk must be
<i>belles-lettres</i>. That is wi-ide.</said>
</P>

<P>
Naumann's pronunciation of the vowel seemed to stretch the word
satirically.  Will did not half like it, but managed to laugh: and Mr.
Casaubon, while he felt some disgust at the artist's German accent,
began to entertain a little respect for his judicious severity.
</P>

<P>
The respect was not diminished when Naumann, after drawing Will aside
for a moment and looking, first at a large canvas, then at Mr.
Casaubon, came forward again and said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">My friend Ladislaw thinks you will pardon me, sir, if I say that a
sketch of your head would be invaluable to me for the St. Thomas
Aquinas in my picture there.  It is too much to ask; but I so seldom
see just what I want—the idealistic in the real.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">You astonish me greatly, sir,</said> said Mr. Casaubon, his looks improved
with a glow of delight; <said who="#C">but if my poor physiognomy, which I have been
accustomed to regard as of the commonest order, can be of any use to
you in furnishing some traits for the angelical doctor, I shall feel
honored.  That is to say, if the operation will not be a lengthy one;
and if Mrs. Casaubon will not object to the delay.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> As for Dorothea, nothing could have pleased her more, unless it had
been a miraculous voice pronouncing Mr. Casaubon the wisest and
worthiest among the sons of men.  In that case her tottering faith
would have become firm again. </said>
</P>

<P>
Naumann's apparatus was at hand in wonderful completeness, and the
sketch went on at once as well as the conversation. <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> Dorothea sat down
and subsided into calm silence, feeling happier than she had done for a
long while before.  Every one about her seemed good, and she said to
herself that Rome, if she had only been less ignorant, would have been
full of beauty: its sadness would have been winged with hope. </said> No nature
could be less suspicious than hers: when she was a child she believed
in the gratitude of wasps and the honorable susceptibility of sparrows,
and was proportionately indignant when their baseness was made manifest.
</P>

<P>
The adroit artist was asking Mr. Casaubon questions about English
polities, which brought long answers, and, Will meanwhile had perched
himself on some steps in the background overlooking all.
</P>

<P>
Presently Naumann said- <said who="#Naumann"> Now if I could lay this by for half an hour
and take it up again—come and look, Ladislaw—I think it is perfect so
far.</said>
</P>

<P>
Will vented those adjuring interjections which imply that admiration is
too strong for syntax; and Naumann said in a tone of piteous regret—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">Ah—now—if I could but have had more—but you have other
engagements—I could not ask it—or even to come again to-morrow.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Oh, let us stay!</said> said Dorothea.  <said who="#D">We have nothing to do to-day except
go about, have we?</said> she added, looking entreatingly at Mr. Casaubon.
<said>It would be a pity not to make the head as good as possible.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">I am at your service, sir, in the matter,</said> said Mr. Casaubon, with
polite condescension.  <said who="#C">Having given up the interior of my head to
idleness, it is as well that the exterior should work in this way.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">You are unspeakably good—now I am happy!</said> said Naumann, and then went
on in German to Will, pointing here and there to the sketch as if he
were considering that.  Putting it aside for a moment, he looked round
vaguely, as if seeking some occupation for his visitors, and afterwards
turning to Mr. Casaubon, said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Perhaps the beautiful bride, the gracious lady, would not be unwilling
to let me fill up the time by trying to make a slight sketch of
her—not, of course, as you see, for that picture—only as a single
study.</said>
</P>

<P>
Mr. Casaubon, bowing, doubted not that Mrs. Casaubon would oblige him,
and Dorothea said, at once, <said who="#D">Where shall I put myself?</said>
</P>

<P>
Naumann was all apologies in asking her to stand, and allow him to
adjust her attitude, to which she submitted without any of the affected
airs and laughs frequently thought necessary on such occasions, when
the painter said, <said who="#Naumann">It is as Santa Clara that I want you to
stand—leaning so, with your cheek against your hand—so—looking at
that stool, please, so!</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> Will was divided between the inclination to fall at the Saint's feet
and kiss her robe, and the temptation to knock Naumann down while he
was adjusting her arm.  All this was impudence and desecration, and he
repented that he had brought her. </said>
</P>

<P>
The artist was diligent, and Will recovering himself moved about and
occupied Mr. Casaubon as ingeniously as he could; but he did not in the
end prevent the time from seeming long to that gentleman, as was clear
from his expressing a fear that Mrs. Casaubon would be tired.  Naumann
took the hint and said—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">Now, sir, if you can oblige me again; I will release the lady-wife.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Neumann" direct="false" aloud="false">So Mr. Casaubon's patience held out further, and when after all it
turned out that the head of Saint Thomas Aquinas would be more perfect
if another sitting could be had, it was granted for the morrow.  On the
morrow Santa Clara too was retouched more than once. </said> The result of all
was so far from displeasing to Mr. Casaubon, that he arranged for the
purchase of the picture in which Saint Thomas Aquinas sat among the
doctors of the Church in a disputation too abstract to be represented,
but listened to with more or less attention by an audience above.  The
Santa Clara, which was spoken of in the second place, Naumann declared
himself to be dissatisfied with—he could not, in conscience, engage
to make a worthy picture of it; so about the Santa Clara the
arrangement was conditional.
</P>

<P>
<first> I will not dwell on Naumann's jokes at the expense of Mr. Casaubon that
evening, or on his dithyrambs about Dorothea's charm, in all which Will
joined, but with a difference. </first> <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> No sooner did Naumann mention any
detail of Dorothea's beauty, than Will got exasperated at his
presumption: there was grossness in his choice of the most ordinary
words, and what business had he to talk of her lips?  She was not a
woman to be spoken of as other women were.  Will could not say just
what he thought, but he became irritable. </said> And yet, when after some
resistance he had consented to take the Casaubons to his friend's
studio, he had been allured by the gratification of his pride in being
the person who could grant Naumann such an opportunity of studying her
loveliness—or rather her divineness, for the ordinary phrases which
might apply to mere bodily prettiness were not applicable to her.
<said who="#MM" direct="false" aloud="false"> (Certainly all Tipton and its neighborhood, as well as Dorothea
herself, would have been surprised at her beauty being made so much of.
In that part of the world Miss Brooke had been only a "fine young
woman.") </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad"> Oblige me by letting the subject drop, Naumann.  Mrs. Casaubon is not
to be talked of as if she were a model,</said> said Will.  Naumann stared at
him.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Naumann">Schön!  I will talk of my Aquinas.  The head is not a bad type, after
all.  I dare say the great scholastic himself would have been flattered
to have his portrait asked for.  Nothing like these starchy doctors for
vanity!  It was as I thought: he cared much less for her portrait than
his own.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">He's a cursed white-blooded pedantic coxcomb,</said> said Will, with
gnashing impetuosity.  His obligations to Mr. Casaubon were not known
to his hearer, but Will himself was thinking of them, and wishing that
he could discharge them all by a check.
</P>

<P>
Naumann gave a shrug and said, <said who="#Naumann">It is good they go away soon, my dear.
They are spoiling your fine temper.</said>
</P>

<P>
All Will's hope and contrivance were now concentrated on seeing
Dorothea when she was alone.  He only wanted her to take more emphatic
notice of him; he only wanted to be something more special in her
remembrance than he could yet believe himself likely to be.  He was
rather impatient under that open ardent good-will, which he saw was her
usual state of feeling.  The remote worship of a woman throned out of
their reach plays a great part in men's lives, but in most cases the
worshipper longs for some queenly recognition, some approving sign by
which his soul's sovereign may cheer him without descending from her
high place.  That was precisely what Will wanted. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> But there were
plenty of contradictions in his imaginative demands.  It was beautiful
to see how Dorothea's eyes turned with wifely anxiety and beseeching to
Mr. Casaubon: she would have lost some of her halo if she had been
without that duteous preoccupation; and yet at the next moment the
husband's sandy absorption of such nectar was too intolerable; and
Will's longing to say damaging things about him was perhaps not the
less tormenting because he felt the strongest reasons for restraining
it. </said>
</P>

<P>
Will had not been invited to dine the next day. <said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> Hence he persuaded
himself that he was bound to call, and that the only eligible time was
the middle of the day, when Mr. Casaubon would not be at home. </said>
</P>

<P>
Dorothea, who had not been made aware that her former reception of Will
had displeased her husband, had no hesitation about seeing him,
especially as he might be come to pay a farewell visit.  When he
entered she was looking at some cameos which she had been buying for
Celia.  She greeted Will as if his visit were quite a matter of course,
and said at once, having a cameo bracelet in her hand—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I am so glad you are come.  Perhaps you understand all about cameos,
and can tell me if these are really good.  I wished to have you with us
in choosing them, but Mr. Casaubon objected: he thought there was not
time.  He will finish his work to-morrow, and we shall go away in three
days.  I have been uneasy about these cameos.  Pray sit down and look
at them.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I am not particularly knowing, but there can be no great mistake about
these little Homeric bits: they are exquisitely neat.  And the color is
fine: it will just suit you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Oh, they are for my sister, who has quite a different complexion.  You
saw her with me at Lowick: she is light-haired and very pretty—at
least I think so.  We were never so long away from each other in our
lives before.  She is a great pet and never was naughty in her life.  I
found out before I came away that she wanted me to buy her some cameos,
and I should be sorry for them not to be good—after their kind.</said>
Dorothea added the last words with a smile.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">You seem not to care about cameos,</said> said Will, seating himself at some
distance from her, and observing her while she closed the cases.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">No, frankly, I don't think them a great object in life,</said> said Dorothea.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I fear you are a heretic about art generally.  How is that?  I should
have expected you to be very sensitive to the beautiful everywhere.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I suppose I am dull about many things,</said> said Dorothea, simply.  <said who="#D">I
should like to make life beautiful—I mean everybody's life.  And then
all this immense expense of art, that seems somehow to lie outside life
and make it no better for the world, pains one.  It spoils my enjoyment
of anything when I am made to think that most people are shut out from
it.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I call that the fanaticism of sympathy,</said> said Will, impetuously.  <said who="#Lad">You
might say the same of landscape, of poetry, of all refinement.  If you
carried it out you ought to be miserable in your own goodness, and turn
evil that you might have no advantage over others.  The best piety is
to enjoy—when you can.  You are doing the most then to save the
earth's character as an agreeable planet.  And enjoyment radiates.  It
is of no use to try and take care of all the world; that is being taken
care of when you feel delight—in art or in anything else.  Would you
turn all the youth of the world into a tragic chorus, wailing and
moralizing over misery?  I suspect that you have some false belief in
the virtues of misery, and want to make your life a martyrdom.</said>  Will
had gone further than he intended, and checked himself.  But Dorothea's
thought was not taking just the same direction as his own, and she
answered without any special emotion—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Indeed you mistake me.  I am not a sad, melancholy creature.  I am
never unhappy long together.  I am angry and naughty—not like Celia: I
have a great outburst, and then all seems glorious again.  I cannot
help believing in glorious things in a blind sort of way.  I should be
quite willing to enjoy the art here, but there is so much that I don't
know the reason of—so much that seems to me a consecration of ugliness
rather than beauty.  The painting and sculpture may be wonderful, but
the feeling is often low and brutal, and sometimes even ridiculous.
Here and there I see what takes me at once as noble—something that I
might compare with the Alban Mountains or the sunset from the Pincian
Hill; but that makes it the greater pity that there is so little of the
best kind among all that mass of things over which men have toiled so.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Of course there is always a great deal of poor work: the rarer things
want that soil to grow in.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Oh dear,</said> said Dorothea, taking up that thought into the chief current
of her anxiety; <said who="#D">I see it must be very difficult to do anything good.
I have often felt since I have been in Rome that most of our lives
would look much uglier and more bungling than the pictures, if they
could be put on the wall.</said>
</P>

<P>
Dorothea parted her lips again as if she were going to say more, but
changed her mind and paused.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">You are too young—it is an anachronism for you to have such
thoughts,</said> said Will, energetically, with a quick shake of the head
habitual to him.  <said who="#Lad">You talk as if you had never known any youth.  It is
monstrous—as if you had had a vision of Hades in your childhood, like
the boy in the legend.  You have been brought up in some of those
horrible notions that choose the sweetest women to devour—like
Minotaurs. And now you will go and be shut up in that stone prison at
Lowick: you will be buried alive.  It makes me savage to think of it!
I would rather never have seen you than think of you with such a
prospect.</said>
</P>

<P>
<first> Will again feared that he had gone too far; but the meaning we attach
to words depends on our feeling, and his tone of angry regret had so
much kindness in it for Dorothea's heart, which had always been giving
out ardor and had never been fed with much from the living beings
around her, that she felt a new sense of gratitude and answered with a
gentle smile— </first>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">It is very good of you to be anxious about me.  It is because you did
not like Lowick yourself: you had set your heart on another kind of
life.  But Lowick is my chosen home.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> The last sentence was spoken with an almost solemn cadence, and Will
did not know what to say, since it would not be useful for him to
embrace her slippers, and tell her that he would die for her: it was
clear that she required nothing of the sort; </said> and they were both silent
for a moment or two, when Dorothea began again with an air of saying at
last what had been in her mind beforehand.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I wanted to ask you again about something you said the other day.
Perhaps it was half of it your lively way of speaking: I notice that
you like to put things strongly; I myself often exaggerate when I speak
hastily.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">What was it?</said> said Will, observing that she spoke with a timidity
quite new in her.  <said who="#Lad">I have a hyperbolical tongue: it catches fire as it
goes.  I dare say I shall have to retract.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I mean what you said about the necessity of knowing German—I mean,
for the subjects that Mr. Casaubon is engaged in.  I have been thinking
about it; and it seems to me that with Mr. Casaubon's learning he must
have before him the same materials as German scholars—has he not?</said>
Dorothea's timidity was due to an indistinct consciousness that she was
in the strange situation of consulting a third person about the
adequacy of Mr. Casaubon's learning.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Not exactly the same materials,</said> said Will, thinking that he would be
duly reserved.  <said who="#Lad">He is not an Orientalist, you know.  He does not
profess to have more than second-hand knowledge there.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">But there are very valuable books about antiquities which were written
a long while ago by scholars who knew nothing about these modern
things; and they are still used.  Why should Mr. Casaubon's not be
valuable, like theirs?</said> said Dorothea, with more remonstrant energy.
She was impelled to have the argument aloud, which she had been having
in her own mind.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">That depends on the line of study taken,</said> said Will, also getting a
tone of rejoinder.  <said who="#Lad">The subject Mr. Casaubon has chosen is as changing
as chemistry: new discoveries are constantly making new points of view.
Who wants a system on the basis of the four elements, or a book to
refute Paracelsus?  Do you not see that it is no use now to be crawling
a little way after men of the last century—men like Bryant—and
correcting their mistakes?—living in a lumber-room and furbishing up
broken-legged theories about Chus and Mizraim?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">How can you bear to speak so lightly?</said> said Dorothea, with a look
between sorrow and anger.  <said who="#D">If it were as you say, what could be sadder
than so much ardent labor all in vain?  I wonder it does not affect you
more painfully, if you really think that a man like Mr. Casaubon, of so
much goodness, power, and learning, should in any way fail in what has
been the labor of his best years.</said> <said who="#D" direct="false" aloud="false"> She was beginning to be shocked that
she had got to such a point of supposition, and indignant with Will for
having led her to it. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">You questioned me about the matter of fact, not of feeling,</said> said
Will.  <said who="#Lad">But if you wish to punish me for the fact, I submit.  I am not
in a position to express my feeling toward Mr. Casaubon: it would be at
best a pensioner's eulogy.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Pray excuse me,</said> said Dorothea, coloring deeply.  <said who="#D">I am aware, as you
say, that I am in fault in having introduced the subject.  Indeed, I am
wrong altogether.  Failure after long perseverance is much grander than
never to have a striving good enough to be called a failure.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I quite agree with you,</said> said Will, determined to change the
situation—<said who="#Lad"> so much so that I have made up my mind not to run that
risk of never attaining a failure.  Mr. Casaubon's generosity has
perhaps been dangerous to me, and I mean to renounce the liberty it has
given me.  I mean to go back to England shortly and work my own
way—depend on nobody else than myself.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">That is fine—I respect that feeling,</said> said Dorothea, with returning
kindness.  <said who="#D">But Mr. Casaubon, I am sure, has never thought of anything
in the matter except what was most for your welfare.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">She has obstinacy and pride enough to serve instead of love, now she
has married him,</said> said Will to himself.  Aloud he said, rising—
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I shall not see you again.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Oh, stay till Mr. Casaubon comes,</said> said Dorothea, earnestly.  <said who="#D">I am so
glad we met in Rome.  I wanted to know you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">And I have made you angry,</said> said Will.  <said who="#Lad">I have made you think ill of
me.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Oh no.  My sister tells me I am always angry with people who do not
say just what I like.  But I hope I am not given to think ill of them.
In the end I am usually obliged to think ill of myself for being so
impatient.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Still, you don't like me; I have made myself an unpleasant thought to
you.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Not at all,</said> said Dorothea, with the most open kindness.  <said who="#D">I like you
very much.</said>
</P>

<P>
Will was not quite contented, thinking that he would apparently have
been of more importance if he had been disliked.  He said nothing, but
looked dull, not to say sulky.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">And I am quite interested to see what you will do,</said> Dorothea went on
cheerfully.  <said who="#D">I believe devoutly in a natural difference of vocation.
If it were not for that belief, I suppose I should be very narrow—there
are so many things, besides painting, that I am quite ignorant
of.  You would hardly believe how little I have taken in of music and
literature, which you know so much of.  I wonder what your vocation
will turn out to be: perhaps you will be a poet?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">That depends.  To be a poet is to have a soul so quick to discern that
no shade of quality escapes it, and so quick to feel, that discernment
is but a hand playing with finely ordered variety on the chords of
emotion—a soul in which knowledge passes instantaneously into feeling,
and feeling flashes back as a new organ of knowledge.  One may have
that condition by fits only.</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">But you leave out the poems,</said> said Dorothea.  <said who="#D">I think they are wanted
to complete the poet.  I understand what you mean about knowledge
passing into feeling, for that seems to be just what I experience.  But
I am sure I could never produce a poem.</said>
</P>

<P>
<first> <said who="#Lad">You <emph rend="italics">are</emph> a poem—and that is to be the best part of a poet—what
makes up the poet's consciousness in his best moods,</said> said Will,
showing such originality as we all share with the morning and the
spring-time and other endless renewals. </first>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I am very glad to hear it,</said> said Dorothea, laughing out her words in a
bird-like modulation, and looking at Will with playful gratitude in her
eyes.  <said who="#D">What very kind things you say to me!</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">I wish I could ever do anything that would be what you call kind—that
I could ever be of the slightest service to you. I fear I shall never
have the opportunity.</said>  Will spoke with fervor.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">Oh yes,</said> said Dorothea, cordially.  <said who="#D">It will come; and I shall
remember how well you wish me.  I quite hoped that we should be friends
when I first saw you—because of your relationship to Mr. Casaubon.</said>
There was a certain liquid brightness in her eyes, and Will was
conscious that his own were obeying a law of nature and filling too.
<said who="#Lad" direct="false" aloud="false"> The allusion to Mr. Casaubon would have spoiled all if anything at that
moment could have spoiled the subduing power, the sweet dignity, of her
noble unsuspicious inexperience. </said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D"> And there is one thing even now that you can do,</said> said Dorothea,
rising and walking a little way under the strength of a recurring
impulse.  <said who="#D">Promise me that you will not again, to any one, speak of
that subject—I mean about Mr. Casaubon's writings—I mean in that
kind of way.  It was I who led to it.  It was my fault.  But promise
me.</said>
</P>

<P>
She had returned from her brief pacing and stood opposite Will, looking
gravely at him.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#Lad">Certainly, I will promise you,</said> said Will, reddening however.  If he
never said a cutting word about Mr. Casaubon again and left off
receiving favors from him, it would clearly be permissible to hate him
the more.  The poet must know how to hate, says Goethe; and Will was at
least ready with that accomplishment.  He said that he must go now
without waiting for Mr. Casaubon, whom he would come to take leave of
at the last moment.  Dorothea gave him her hand, and they exchanged a
simple <said> Good-by.</said>
</P>

<P>
But going out of the <i>porte cochere</i> he met Mr. Casaubon, and that
gentleman, expressing the best wishes for his cousin, politely waived
the pleasure of any further leave-taking on the morrow, which would be
sufficiently crowded with the preparations for departure.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I have something to tell you about our cousin Mr. Ladislaw, which I
think will heighten your opinion of him,</said> said Dorothea to her husband
in the course of the evening. <first> She had mentioned immediately on his
entering that Will had just gone away, and would come again, but Mr.
Casaubon had said, <said who="#D">I met him outside, and we made our final adieux, I
believe,</said> saying this with the air and tone by which we imply that any
subject, whether private or public, does not interest us enough to wish
for a further remark upon it.  So Dorothea had waited. </first>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">What is that, my love?</said> said Mr Casaubon (he always said <said>my love</said>
when his manner was the coldest).
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">He has made up his mind to leave off wandering at once, and to give up
his dependence on your generosity.  He means soon to go back to
England, and work his own way.  I thought you would consider that a
good sign,</said> said Dorothea, with an appealing look into her husband's
neutral face.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">Did he mention the precise order of occupation to which he would
addict himself?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">No. But he said that he felt the danger which lay for him in your
generosity.  Of course he will write to you about it.  Do you not think
better of him for his resolve?</said>
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">I shall await his communication on the subject,</said> said Mr. Casaubon.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#D">I told him I was sure that the thing you considered in all you did for
him was his own welfare.  I remembered your goodness in what you said
about him when I first saw him at Lowick,</said> said Dorothea, putting her
hand on her husband's.
</P>

<P>
<said who="#C">I had a duty towards him,</said> said Mr. Casaubon, laying his other hand on
Dorothea's in conscientious acceptance of her caress, but with a glance
which he could not hinder from being uneasy.  <said who="#C">The young man, I
confess, is not otherwise an object of interest to me, nor need we, I
think, discuss his future course, which it is not ours to determine
beyond the limits which I have sufficiently indicated.</said> Dorothea did
not mention Will again.
</P>
